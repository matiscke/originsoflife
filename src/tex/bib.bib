  abstract = {Abstract Due to impact degassing during accretion, a hot H2O-rich proto-atmosphere was possibly formed on the growing Earth. We investigate the evolution of an impact-generated H2O--CO2 atmosphere at the final stage of accretion by using a one-dimensional radiative-convective atmosphere model. Since atmospheric pressure is high ({$\sim$}200 bar) and close to the critical point of water vapor (647 K, 220 bar), we need to take into account the nonideal behavior of gases in the calculation. It is shown that the surface temperature suddenly decreases when the impact (accretion) energy flux decreases to about 150 W m-2, and that a proto-ocean is formed on the growing Earth. The estimated temperature of a proto-ocean is consistent with that of an archaean ocean estimated from the oxygen isotope data.},

  abstract = {The first part of this paper discusses how planet formation proceeds in the disks orbiting M dwarf stars. These environments are different from those associated with solar-type stars in several ways: The planet forming clock (set by orbits) runs slower, the disks are more prone to evaporation, the supply of raw material is lower, the snowline is closer in, and planetary systems are more easily disrupted. Because of these considerations, red dwarfs are less likely to harbor giant planets, but can readily produce smaller planets. The second part of this paper describes stellar evolution calculations for M dwarfs, which live far longer than the current age of the universe. These diminutive stellar objects remain convective over most of their lives, continue to burn hydrogen for trillions of years, and do not experience red giant phases in their old age. Instead, red dwarfs turn into blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs. This work also shows (in part) why larger stars become red giants. ({\copyright} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

  abstract = {This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for gas giant planets forming via the core accretion paradigm. Starting with known properties of circumstellar disks, we present models for the planetary mass distribution over the range 0.1M J {$\leq$} M p {$<$} 10M J. If the circumstellar disk lifetime is solely responsible for the end of planetary mass accretion, the observed (nearly) exponential distribution of disk lifetime would imprint an exponential falloff in the planetary mass function. This result is in apparent conflict with observations, which suggest that the mass distribution has a (nearly) power-law form of , with an index of p {$\approx$} 1.3, over the relevant planetary mass range (and for stellar masses {$\sim$}0.5--2M {$\odot$}). The mass accretion rate onto the planet depends on the fraction of the (circumstellar) disk accretion flow that enters the Hill sphere, and on the efficiency with which the planet captures the incoming material. Models for the planetary mass function that include distributions for these efficiencies, with uninformed priors, can produce nearly power-law behavior, consistent with current observations. The disk lifetimes, accretion rates, and other input parameters depend on the mass of the host star. We show how these variations lead to different forms for the planetary mass function for different stellar masses. Compared to stars with masses M * = 0.5--2M {$\odot$}, stars with smaller masses are predicted to have a steeper planetary mass function (fewer large planets).},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of Sun-like stars are priority targets for detection and observation by the next generation of space telescopes. Earth's long-term habitability may have been tied to the geological carbon cycle, a process critically facilitated by plate tectonics. In the modern Earth, plate motion corresponds to a mantle convection regime called mobile lid. The alternate, stagnant-lid regime is found on Mars and Venus, which may have lacked strong enough weathering feedback to sustain surface liquid water over geological timescales if initially present. Constraining observational strategies able to infer the most common regime in terrestrial exoplanets requires quantitative predictions of the atmospheric composition of planets in either regime. We use end-member models of volcanic outgassing and crust weathering for the stagnant- and mobile-lid convection regimes, which we couple to models of atmospheric chemistry and climate and ocean chemistry to simulate the atmospheric evolution of these worlds in the HZ. In our simulations under the two alternate regimes, we find that the fraction of planets possessing climates consistent with surface liquid water is virtually the same. Despite this unexpected similarity, we predict that a mission capable of detecting atmospheric CO2 abundance above 0.1 bar in 25 terrestrial exoplanets is extremely likely ({$\geq$}95\% of samples) to infer the dominant interior convection regime in that sample with strong evidence (10:1 odds). This offers guidance for the specifications of the Habitable Worlds Observatory NASA concept mission and other future missions capable of probing samples of habitable exoplanets.},

In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (that is, elements heavier than helium, also called `metallicity')1--3, and thus the formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants4--6. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets7--9. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2, but have not yielded definitive detections owing to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification10--12. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with~JWST as part of the Early Release Science programme13,14. The data used in this study span 3.0--5.5\,micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3\,micrometres (26-sigma significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, ten-times solar metallicity models that assume radiative--convective--thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0\,micrometres that is not reproduced by these models.},

In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} An important future goal in exoplanetology is to detect and characterize potentially habitable planets. Concepts for future space missions have already been proposed: from a large UV-optical-infrared space mission for studies in reflected light, to the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) for analyzing the thermal portion of the planetary spectrum. Using nulling interferometry, LIFE will allow us to constrain the radius and effective temperature of (terrestrial) exoplanets, as well as provide unique information about their atmospheric structure and composition.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We explore the potential of LIFE for characterizing emission spectra of Earth at various stages of its evolution. This allows us (1) to test the robustness of Bayesian atmospheric retrieval frameworks when branching out from a modern Earth scenario while still remaining in the realm of habitable (and inhabited) exoplanets, and (2) to refine the science requirements for LIFE for the detection and characterization of habitable, terrestrial exoplanets.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We performed Bayesian retrievals on simulated spectra of eight different scenarios, which correspond to cloud-free and cloudy spectra of four different epochs of the evolution of the Earth. Assuming a distance of 10 pc and a Sun-like host star, we simulated observations obtained with LIFE using its simulator LIFEsim, considering all major astrophysical noise sources.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} With the nominal spectral resolution \emph{(R{$<$}i/{$>$} = 50) and signal-to-noise ratio (assumed to be S/N = 10 at 11.2 {$\mu$}m), we can identify the main spectral features of all the analyzed scenarios (most notably CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}, H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O, O\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$}). This allows us to distinguish between inhabited and lifeless scenarios. Results suggest that O3 and CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$} in particular yield an improved abundance estimate by doubling the S/N from 10 to 20. Neglecting clouds in the retrieval still allows for a correct characterization of the atmospheric composition. However, correct cloud modeling is necessary to avoid biases in the retrieval of the correct thermal structure.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} From this analysis, we conclude that the baseline requirements for R and S/N are sufficient for LIFE to detect O\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$} and CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$} in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet with an O\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} abundance of around 2\% in volume mixing ratio. Doubling the S/N would allow a clearer detection of these species at lower abundances. This information is relevant in terms of the LIFE mission planning. We also conclude that cloud-free retrievals of cloudy planets can be used to characterize the atmospheric composition of terrestrial habitable planets, but not the thermal structure of the atmosphere. From the inter-model comparison performed, we deduce that differences in the opacity tables (caused by, e.g., a different line wing treatment) may be an important source of systematic errors.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Two direct imaging space mission concepts are being developed: the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). HWO focuses on reflected light spectra in the ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR), while LIFE captures the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of temperate exoplanets. We assess the potential of HWO and LIFE in characterizing a cloud-free Earth twin orbiting a Sun-like star at 10 pc, both separately and synergistically, aiming to quantify the increase in information from joint atmospheric retrievals on a habitable planet. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated data from an HWO-like and a LIFE-like mission separately, then jointly, considering the baseline spectral resolutions currently assumed for these concepts and using two increasingly complex noise simulations. HWO would constrain H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_2\$, and O\$\_3\$, in the atmosphere, with {\textasciitilde} 100 K uncertainty on the temperature profile. LIFE would constrain CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_3\$ and provide constraints on the thermal atmospheric structure and surface temperature ({\textasciitilde} 10 K uncertainty). Both missions would provide an upper limit on CH\$\_4\$. Joint retrievals on HWO and LIFE data would accurately define the atmospheric thermal profile and planetary parameters, decisively constrain CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_2\$, and O\$\_3\$, and weakly constrain CO and CH\$\_4\$. The detection significance is greater or equal to single-instrument retrievals. Both missions provide specific information to characterize a terrestrial habitable exoplanet, but the scientific yield is maximized with synergistic UV/VIS/NIR+MIR observations. Using HWO and LIFE together will provide stronger constraints on biosignatures and life indicators, potentially transforming the search for life in the universe.},

Two direct imaging space mission concepts are being developed: the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). HWO focuses on reflected light spectra in the ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR), while LIFE captures the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of temperate exoplanets. We assess the potential of HWO and LIFE in characterizing a cloud-free Earth twin orbiting a Sun-like star at 10 pc, both separately and synergistically, aiming to quantify the increase in information from joint atmospheric retrievals on a habitable planet. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated data from an HWO-like and a LIFE-like mission separately, then jointly, considering the baseline spectral resolutions currently assumed for these concepts and using two increasingly complex noise simulations. HWO would constrain H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_2\$, and O\$\_3\$, in the atmosphere, with {\textasciitilde} 100 K uncertainty on the temperature profile. LIFE would constrain CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_3\$ and provide constraints on the thermal atmospheric structure and surface temperature ({\textasciitilde} 10 K uncertainty). Both missions would provide an upper limit on CH\$\_4\$. Joint retrievals on HWO and LIFE data would accurately define the atmospheric thermal profile and planetary parameters, decisively constrain CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_2\$, and O\$\_3\$, and weakly constrain CO and CH\$\_4\$. The detection significance is greater or equal to single-instrument retrievals. Both missions provide specific information to characterize a terrestrial habitable exoplanet, but the scientific yield is maximized with synergistic UV/VIS/NIR+MIR observations. Using HWO and LIFE together will provide stronger constraints on biosignatures and life indicators, potentially transforming the search for life in the universe.},

  abstract = {Recent surveys show that protoplanetary disks have lower levels of turbulence than expected based on their observed accretion rates. A viable solution to this is that magnetized disk winds dominate angular momentum transport. This has several important implications for planet formation processes. We compute the physical and chemical evolution of disks and the formation and migration of planets under the combined effects of angular momentum transport by turbulent viscosity and disk winds. We take into account the critical role of planet traps to limit Type I migration in all of these models and compute thousands of planet evolution tracks for single planets drawn from a distribution of initial disk properties and turbulence strengths. We do not consider multi-planet models nor include N-body planet-planet interactions. Within this physical framework we find that populations with a constant value disk turbulence and winds strength produce mass-semimajor axis distributions in the M-a diagram with insufficient scatter to compare reasonably with observations. However, populations produced as a consequence of sampling disks with a distribution of the relative strengths of disk turbulence and winds fit much better. Such models give rise to a substantial super Earth population at orbital radii 0.03-2 AU, as well as a clear separation between the produced hot Jupiter and warm Jupiter populations. Additionally, this model results in a good comparison with the exoplanetary mass-radius distribution in the M-R diagram after post-disk atmospheric photoevaporation is accounted for.},

  abstract = {In the general classical picture of pebble-based core growth, planetary cores grow by accretion of single pebble species. The growing planet may reach the so-called pebble isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that blocks inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling core growth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic simulations, pebble filtration by the pressure bump depends on several parameters including core mass, disc structure, turbulent viscosity and pebble size. We have investigated how accretion of multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth rates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on turbulent viscosity and pebble size sets the final core masses. We performed numerical simulations in a viscous one-dimensional disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth, fragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates and final core masses are sensitive to three key parameters: the threshold velocity at which pebbles fragment on collision, the turbulent viscosity and the distribution of pebble species, which yield a diversity of planetary cores. With accretion of multiple pebble species, planetary cores can grow very fast, reaching over 30-40 ME in mass. Potential cores of cold gas giants were able to form from embryos initially implanted as far as 50 au. Our results suggest that accretion of multispecies pebbles could explain: the estimated 25-45 ME heavy element abundance inside Jupiter's core; the massive cores of extrasolar planets; the disc rings and gaps at wider orbits; and the early and rapid formation of planetary bodies.},

  abstract = {Highly eccentric orbits are one of the major surprises of exoplanets relative to the solar system and indicate rich and tumultuous dynamical histories. One system of particular interest is Kepler-1656, which hosts a sub-Jovian planet with an eccentricity of 0.8. Sufficiently eccentric orbits will shrink in the semimajor axis due to tidal dissipation of orbital energy during periastron passage. Here our goal was to assess whether Kepler-1656b is currently undergoing such high-eccentricity migration, and to further understand the system's origins and architecture. We confirm a second planet in the system with M c = 0.40 {\textpm} 0.09 M jup and Pc = 1919 {\textpm} 27 days. We simulated the dynamical evolution of planet b in the presence of planet c and find a variety of possible outcomes for the system, such as tidal migration and engulfment. The system is consistent with an in situ dynamical origin of planet b followed by subsequent eccentric Kozai-Lidov perturbations that excite Kepler-1656b's eccentricity gently, i.e., without initiating tidal migration. Thus, despite its high eccentricity, we find no evidence that planet b is or has migrated through the high-eccentricity channel. Finally, we predict the outer orbit to be mutually inclined in a nearly perpendicular configuration with respect to the inner planet orbit based on the outcomes of our simulations and make observable predictions for the inner planet's spin-orbit angle. Our methodology can be applied to other eccentric or tidally locked planets to constrain their origins, orbital configurations, and properties of a potential companion.},

  abstract = {Phosphine could be a key molecule in the understanding of exotic chemistry happening in (exo)planetary atmospheres. While it has been detected in the Solar System's giant planets, it has not been observed in exoplanets yet. In the exoplanetary context however it has been theorized as a potential biosignature molecule. The goal of our study is to identify which illustrative science cases for PH3 chemistry are observable with a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometric observatory like the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets) concept. We identified a representative set of scenarios for PH3 detections in exoplanetary atmospheres varying over the whole dynamic range of the LIFE mission. We used chemical kinetics and radiative transfer calculations to produce forward models of these informative, prototypical observational cases for LIFEsim, our observation simulator software for LIFE. In a detailed, yet first order approximation it takes a mission like LIFE: (i) about 1h to find phosphine in a warm giant around a G star at 10 pc, (ii) about 10 h in H2 or CO2 dominated temperate super-Earths around M star hosts at 5 pc, (iii) and even in 100h it seems very unlikely that phosphine would be detectable in a Venus-Twin with extreme PH3 concentrations at 5 pc. Phosphine in concentrations previously discussed in the literature is detectable in 2 out of the 3 cases and about an order of magnitude faster than comparable cases with JWST. We show that there is a significant number of objects accessible for these classes of observations. These results will be used to prioritize the parameter range for the next steps with more detailed retrieval simulations. They will also inform timely questions in the early design phase of a mission like LIFE and guide the community by providing easy-to-scale first estimates for a large part of detection space of such a mission.},

In this work, we explore nontopological solitonic configurations, specifically Q-balls, and study when they may form macroscopic astrophysical structures and what their distinct characteristics might be. We study in some detail theoretical bounds on their sizes and constraints on the underlying parameters, based on criteria for an astrophysical Q-ball's existence, gravitational stability and viability of solutions. Following this path, one is able to obtain novel limits on astrophysical Q-ball sizes and their underlying parameters. We also explore the gravitational lensing features of different astrophysical Q-ball profiles, which are more general than the simple thin-wall limit. It is seen that the magnification characteristics may be very distinct, depending on the actual details of the solution, even for astrophysical Q-balls having the same size and mass. Assuming that such astrophysical Q-balls may form a small component of the dark matter in the Universe, we place limits on this fraction from the gravitational microlensing surveys EROS-2, OGLE-IV, HSC-Subaru and the proposed future survey WFIRST. Exploring various astrophysical Q-ball profiles and sizes, it is found that while for most intermediate masses that we consider, the dark matter fraction comprising astrophysical Q-balls is at most subpercent, for other masses it may be significantly higher.},

Numerical experiments have demonstrated that for these molecules to survive, impacts at very low velocities are required. This work shows that for comets scattered from beyond the snow-line into the habitable zone, the minimum impact velocity is always lower for planets orbiting Solar-type stars than M-dwarfs. Using both an analytical model and numerical N-body simulations, we show that the lowest velocity impacts occur onto planets in tightly packed planetary systems around high-mass (i.e. Solar-mass) stars, enabling the intact delivery of complex organic molecules. Impacts onto planets around low-mass stars are found to be very sensitive to the planetary architecture, with the survival of complex prebiotic molecules potentially impossible in loosely packed systems. Rocky planets around M-dwarfs also suffer significantly more high velocity impacts, potentially posing unique challenges for life on these planets. In the scenario that cometary delivery is important for the origins of life, this study predicts the presence of biosignatures will be correlated with (i) decreasing planetary mass (i.e. escape velocity), (ii) increasing stellar-mass and (iii) decreasing planetary separation (i.e. exoplanets in tightly-packed systems).},

This goal requires a bold new generation of space telescopes, but even the most ambitious designs yet hope to characterize several dozen potentially habitable planets. Such a sample may be too small to truly understand the complexity of exo-earths. We describe here a notional concept for a novel space observatory designed to characterize 1000 transiting exo-earth candidates. The Nautilus concept is based on an array of inflatable spacecraft carrying very large diameter (8.5 m), very low weight, multiorder diffractive optical elements (MODE lenses) as light-collecting elements. The mirrors typical to current space telescopes are replaced by MODE lenses with a 10 times lighter areal density that are 100 times less sensitive to misalignments, enabling lightweight structure. MODE lenses can be cost-effectively replicated through molding. The Nautilus mission concept has a potential to greatly reduce fabrication and launch costs and mission risks compared to the current space telescope paradigm through replicated components and identical, lightweight unit telescopes. Nautilus is designed to survey transiting exo-earths for biosignatures up to a distance of 300 pc, enabling a rigorous statistical exploration of the frequency and properties of life-bearing planets and the diversity of exo-earths.},

NEOSTEL is an optical telescope, 1-meter class primary mirror, that splits the image into 16 CCD cameras mounted on as many objectives (Secondary Optics Tubes-SOTs). Each channel optically works as a single unit of a multi-telescope, and it is equipped with a camera. The NEOSTEL CCD camera is under development within the ESA ASTROCAD program. The 1180mm entrance aperture and the performance of the ASTROCAD camera shall allow scanning two-thirds of the visible sky about three times per night, detecting NEOs down to apparent magnitudes 21.5. ESA, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) identified the location for the installation of the first NEOSTEL prototype on top of the Mount Mufara on the Madonie Chain in Sicily.},

  abstract = {There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science. We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.},

  abstract = {Exoplanets observed by the Kepler telescope exhibit a bimodal, radius distribution, which is known as the radius gap. We explore an origin of the radius gap, focusing on multiplanet systems. Our simple theoretical argument predicts that type I planetary migration produces different configurations of protoplanets with different masses and such different configurations can result in two distinguishable populations of small-sized multiplanet systems. We then perform an observational analysis to verify this prediction. In the analysis, multiple Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are applied to the observed systems, using the statistical measures that are devised to systematically characterize the properties of multiplanet systems. We find with 99.5\% confidence that the observed, small-sized multiplanet systems are divided into two distinct populations. The distinction likely originates from different spatial distributions of protoplanets, which are determined by type I migration and subsequently trigger giant impact. We also show that these distinct populations are separated around the radius gap when the gas surface density of protoplanetary disks is {\textasciitilde}102 g cm-2 in the vicinity of the host stars. This work therefore emphasizes the importance of planetary migration and the inner disk properties.},

  abstract = {When searching for inhabited exoplanets, understanding the boundaries of the habitable zone around the parent star is the key. If life can strongly influence its global environment, then we would expect the boundaries of the habitable zone to be influenced by the presence of life. Here, using a simple abstract model of `tangled-ecology' where life can influence a global parameter, labelled as temperature, we investigate the boundaries of the habitable zone of our model system. As with other models of life-climate interactions, the species act to regulate the temperature. However, the system can also experience `punctuations', where the system's state jumps between different equilibria. Despite this, an ensemble of systems still tends to sustain or even improve conditions for life on average, a feature we call Entropic Gaia. The mechanism behind this is sequential selection with memory which is discussed in detail. With this modelling framework we investigate questions about how Gaia can affect and ultimately extend the habitable zone to what we call the Gaian habitable zone. This generates concrete predictions for the size of the habitable zone around stars, suggests directions for future work on the simulation of exoplanets and provides insight into the Gaian bottleneck hypothesis and the habitability/inhabitance paradox.},

In the present review, we discuss selected examples in these areas in a combined analysis of the state-of-the-art of synthetic methodologies and processes with their life cycle assessment. Thereby, we attempted to assess the potential to reduce the environmental footprint in these application fields relative to the current petrochemical value chain. This analysis and discussion differs significantly from a viewpoint on CO2 utilization as a measure for global CO2 mitigation. Whereas the latter focuses on reducing the end-of-pipe problem ``CO2 emissions'' from todays' industries, the approach taken here tries to identify opportunities by exploiting a novel feedstock that avoids the utilization of fossil resource in transition toward more sustainable future production. Thus, the motivation to develop CO2-based chemistry does not depend primarily on the absolute amount of CO2 emissions that can be remediated by a single technology. Rather, CO2-based chemistry is stimulated by the significance of the relative improvement in carbon balance and other critical factors defining the environmental impact of chemical production in all relevant sectors in accord with the principles of green chemistry.},

When an inward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these planets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We performed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two different ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner boundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density profile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional outer planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems. We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number of planets in the disc inner cavity.},

This is the major breakthrough in studies of protoplanetary disks since Protostars and Planets VI and is reshaping the field of planet formation. However, while the capability of imaging substructures in protoplanetary disks has been steadily improving, the origin of many substructures are still largely debated. The structured distributions of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks likely reflect the outcome of physical processes at work, including the formation of planets. Yet, the diverse properties among the observed protoplanetary disk population, for example, the number and radial location of rings and gaps in the dust distribution, suggest that the controlling process may differ between disks and/or the outcome may be sensitive to stellar or disk properties. In this review, we (1) summarize the existing observations of protoplanetary disk substructures collected from the literature; (2) provide a comprehensive theoretical review of various processes proposed to explain observed protoplanetary disk substructures; (3) compare current theoretical predictions with existing observations and highlight future research directions to distinguish between different origins; and (4) discuss implications of state-of-the-art protoplanetary disk observations to protoplanetary disk and planet formation theory.},

  abstract = {Giant planets have been discovered at large separations from the central star. Moreover, a striking number of young circumstellar disks have gas and/or dust gaps at large orbital separations, potentially driven by embedded planetary objects. To form massive planets at large orbital separations through core accretion within disk lifetime, however, an early solid body to seed pebble and gas accretion is desirable. Young protoplanetary disks are likely self-gravitating, and these gravitoturbulent disks may efficiently concentrate solid material at the midplane driven by spiral waves. We run 3D local hydrodynamical simulations of gravitoturbulent disks with Lagrangian dust particles to determine whether particle and gas self-gravity can lead to the formation of dense solid bodies, seeding later planet formation. When self-gravity between dust particles is included, solids of size \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{St\} = 0.1\$ to \$1\$ concentrate within the gravitoturbulent spiral features and collapse under their own self-gravity into dense clumps up to several \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ in mass at wide orbits. Simulations with dust that drift most efficiently, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{St\}=1\$, form the most massive clouds of particles, while simulations with smaller dust particles, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{St\}=0.1\$, have clumps with masses an order of magnitude lower. When the effect of dust backreaction onto the gas is included, dust clumps become smaller by a factor of a few but more numerous. The existence of large solid bodies at an early stage of the disk can accelerate the planet formation process, particularly at wide orbital separations, and potentially explain planets distant from the central stars and young protoplanetary disks with substructures.},

  abstract = {Circumstellar discs likely have a short window when they are self-gravitating and prone to the effects of disc instability, but during this time the seeds of planet formation can be sown. It has long been argued that disc fragmentation can form large gas giant planets at wide orbital separations, but its place in the planet formation paradigm is hindered by a tendency to form especially large gas giants or brown dwarfs. We instead suggest that planet formation can occur early in massive discs, through the gravitational collapse of dust which can form the seeds of giant planets. This is different from the usual picture of self-gravitating discs, in which planet formation is considered through the gravitational collapse of the gas disc into a gas giant precursor. It is familiar in the sense that the core is formed first, and gas is accreted thereafter, as is the case in the core accretion scenario. However, by forming a \${\textbackslash}sim 1 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ seed from the gravitational collapse of dust within a self-gravitating disc there exists the potential to overcome traditional growth barriers and form a planet within a few times \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ years. The accretion of pebbles is most efficient with centimetre-sized dust, but the accretion of millimetre sizes can also result in formation within a Myr. Thus, if dust can grow to these sizes, planetary seeds formed within very young, massive discs could drastically reduce the timescale of planet formation and potentially explain the observed ring and gap structures in young discs.},

  abstract = {Recent monitoring programmes of ultra-cool field M and L dwarfs (low-mass stars or brown dwarfs) have uncovered low-amplitude photometric I-band variations that may be associated with an inhomogeneous distribution of photospheric condensates. Further evidence hints that this distribution may evolve on very short time-scales, specifically of the order of a rotation period or less. In an attempt to study this behaviour in more detail, we have carried out a pilot programme to monitor three L dwarfs in the near-infrared where these objects are significantly brighter than at shorter wavelengths. We present a robust data analysis method for improving the precision and reliability of infrared photometry. No significant variability was detected in either the J or K{$\prime$} bands in 2M1439 and SDSS1203 above a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.04 mag (0.08 mag for 2M1112). The main limiting factor in achieving lower detection limits is suspected to be second-order extinction effects in the atmosphere of the Earth, on account of the very different colours of the target and reference stars. Suggestions are given for overcoming such effects, which should improve the sensitivity and reliability of infrared variability searches.},

  abstract = {The architecture of a planetary system can influence the habitability of a planet via orbital effects, particularly in the areas of stability and eccentricity. Some of these effects are readily apparent, particularly when they occur on short timescales that are easily numerically calculable. However, the appearance and evolution of life can take place on gigayear timescales, long enough that secular effects become important. These effects are difficult to investigate, as a direct integration requires significant computational time. In this paper, we apply a semi-analytic framework in conjunction with N-body integrations and predictive techniques to determine the relative habitability for an Earth-like planet in a system with two giant companions over a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the integrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a single Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location, spacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including configurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As long as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the terrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the habitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median (\${\textbackslash}pm 1 {\textbackslash}sigma\$) habitable planet has an eccentricity of 0.11 (+0.16, -0.08), though it started circular. Low-mass, widely separated, and moderately eccentric perturbing giants can accomplish this, an "ultra-habitable" configuration of companions.},

We show that even a single detection of biosignatures in the vicinity of our stellar system, in a survey of similar size to what will be obtainable in the next 2 decades, would affect significantly our prior belief on the frequency of life in the universe, even starting from a neutral or pessimistic stance. In particular, after such discovery, an initially agnostic observer would be led to conclude that there are more than  1 0 5 105  inhabited planets in the galaxy with a probability exceeding 95\%. However, this conclusion would be somewhat weakened by the viability of transfer of biological material over interstellar distances, as in panspermia scenarios. Conversely, the lack of significant evidence of biosignatures would have little effect, leaving the assessment of the abundance of life in the galaxy still largely undetermined.},

And because life itself, through photosynthesis, contributed to creating our oxygen-rich atmosphere, oxygen has long been considered as a possible biosignature. Here we consider the relationship between atmospheric oxygen and the development of technology. We argue that only planets with substantial oxygen partial pressure (\$\$p\_\{\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_2\}\$\$) will be capable of developing advanced technospheres and hence technosignatures that we can detect. But open-air combustion (needed, for example, for metallurgy), is possible only in Earth-like atmospheres when \$\$p\_\{\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_2\}\$\$\,{$\geq$}\,18\%. This limit is higher than the one needed to sustain a complex biosphere and multicellular organisms. We further review other possible planetary atmospheric compositions and conclude that oxygen is the most likely candidate for the evolution of technological species. Thus, the presence of \$\$p\_\{\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_2\}\$\$\,{$\geq$}\,18\% in exoplanet atmospheres may represent a contextual prior required for the planning and interpretation of technosignature searches.},

  abstract = {The probability that life spontaneously emerges in a suitable environment (abiogenesis) is one of the major unknowns in astrobiology. Assessing its value is impeded by the lack of an accepted theory for the origin of life, and is further complicated by the existence of selection biases. Appealing uncritically to some version of the `Principle of Mediocrity' -- namely, the supposed typicality of what transpired on Earth -- is problematic on empirical or logical grounds. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian statistical approach to put the inference of lower bounds for the probability of abiogenesis on a rigorous footing, based on current and future evidence. We demonstrate that the single datum that life has appeared at least once on Earth merely sets weak constraints on the minimal probability of abiogenesis. In fact, the a priori probability assigned to this event (viz., optimistic, pessimistic, or agnostic prior) exerts the strongest influence on the final result. We also show that the existence of a large number of habitable worlds does not necessarily imply, by itself, a high probability that life should be common in the universe. Instead, as delineated before, the choice of prior, which is subject to uncertainty (i.e. admits multiple scenarios), strongly influences the likelihood of life being common. If habitable worlds are uncommon, for an agnostic prior, a deterministic scenario for the origin of life might be favoured over one where abiogenesis is a fluke event.},

The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M\_V and mass-M\_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M\_V-(V-I), M\_K-(I-K) and M\_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T\_eff {\textasciitilde} 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour--magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

Here, we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, the physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-minute cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250 {\textpm} 70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 R{$\oplus$}. Furthermore, we predict that an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 R{$\oplus$} with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

However, all the other metal ions exist at much lower concentrations. This paper reports an estimate of the feasibility of the extraction of these metal ions on the basis of the energy needed. In most cases, the result is that extraction in amounts comparable to the present production from land mines would be impossible because of the very large amount of energy needed. This conclusion holds also for uranium as fuel for the present generation of nuclear fission plants. Nevertheless, in a few cases, mainly lithium, extraction from seawater could provide amounts of metals sufficient for closing the cycle of metal use in the economy, provided that an increased level of recycling can be attained.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here, we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high-enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long-enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets ``Tidal Venuses'' and the phenomenon a ``tidal greenhouse.'' Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits (i.e., with negligible tidal heating) in the habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable, as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. We simulated the evolution of hypothetical planetary systems in a quasi-continuous parameter distribution and found that we could constrain the history of the system by statistical arguments. Planets orbiting stars with masses{$<$}0.3 MSun may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We have applied these concepts to Gl 667C c, a {$\sim$}4.5 MEarth planet orbiting a 0.3 MSun star at 0.12 AU. We found that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating, as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for noncircular orbits. In the appendices we review (a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, (b) hydrogen escape, (c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, (d) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and (e) linear tidal theories.

The code is validated by reproducing a selection of observations and past results. VPLanet is written in C and designed so that the user can choose the physics modules to apply to an individual object at runtime without recompiling, i.e., a single executable can simulate the diverse phenomena that are relevant to a wide range of planetary and stellar systems. This feature is enabled by matrices and vectors of function pointers that are dynamically allocated and populated based on user input. The speed and modularity of VPLanet enables large parameter sweeps and the versatility to add/remove physical phenomena to assess their importance. VPLanet is publicly available from a repository that contains extensive documentation, numerous examples, Python scripts for plotting and data management, and infrastructure for community input and future development.},

Then, as now, they encompassed a multiplicity of physical and chemical gradients as a direct result of interactions between extensive hydrothermal activity in the Earth's crust and the overlying oceanic and atmospheric environments. We have proposed that these gradients provided the necessary multiple pathways for the abiotic synthesis of chemical compounds, origin and evolution of `precells' and `precell' communities and, ultimately, the evolution of free-living organisms. This hypothesis is consistent with the tectonic, paleontological, and degassing history of the earth and with the use of thermal energy sources in the laboratory to synthesize amino acids and complex organic compounds. In this paper, we expand upon the geophysical, chemical, and possible microbiological analogies between contemporary and Archean hydrothermal systems and suggest several hypotheses, related to our model for the origin and evolution of life at Archean vents, which can be tested in present-day hydrothermal systems.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of weight percent of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. To understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma-ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present , a versatile magma-ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma-ocean atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth oceans. We also reanalyze the structures of these planets and find they have water mass fractions of 0--0.23, 0.01--0.21, and 0.11--0.24 for planets e, f, and g, respectively. Our model does not make a strong prediction about the water and oxygen content of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e at the time of mantle solidification. In contrast, the model predicts that TRAPPIST-1 f and g would have a thick steam atmosphere with a small amount of oxygen at that stage. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3--5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.},

  abstract = {e Eridani, the fifth-closest Sun-like star, hosts at least three planets and could possibly harbor more. However, the veracity of the planet candidates in the system and its full planetary architecture remain unknown. Here we analyze the planetary architecture of e Eridani via DYNAMITE, a method providing an integrative assessment of the system architecture (and possibly yet-undetected planets) by combining statistical, exoplanet-population level knowledge with incomplete but specific information available on the system. DYNAMITE predicts the most likely location of an additional planet in the system based on the Kepler population demographic information from more than 2000 planets. Additionally, we analyze the dynamical stability of e Eridani system via N-body simulations. Our DYNAMITE and dynamical stability analyses provide support for planet candidates g, c, and f, and also predict one additional planet candidate with an orbital period between 549 -- 733 days, in the habitable zone of the system. We find that planet candidate f, if it exists, would also lie in the habitable zone. Our dynamical stability analysis also shows that the e Eridani planetary eccentricities, as reported, do not allow for a stable system, suggesting that they are lower. We introduce a new statistical approach for estimating the equilibrium and surface temperatures of exoplanets, based on a prior on the planetary albedo distribution. e Eridani is a rich planetary system with a possibility of containing two potentially habitable planets, and its vicinity to our Solar System makes it an important target for future imaging studies and biosignature searches.},

It has a long history of claimed planet detections from both radial velocities and astrometry. However, none of these claimed detections have so far withstood further scrutiny. Continuing this story, extreme precision radial velocity measurements from the ESPRESSO instrument have recently been used to identify four new sub-Earth-mass planet candidates around Barnard's Star. We present here 112 radial velocities of Barnard's Star from the MAROON-X instrument that were obtained independently to search for planets around this compelling object. The data have a typical precision of 30 cm s-1 and are contemporaneous with the published ESPRESSO measurements (2021--2023). The MAROON-X data on their own confirm planet b (P = 3.154 days) and planet candidates c and d (P = 4.124 and 2.340 days, respectively). Furthermore, adding the MAROON-X data to the ESPRESSO data strengthens the evidence for planet candidate e (P = 6.739 days), thus leading to its confirmation. The signals from all four planets are {$<$}50 cm s-1, the minimum masses of the planets range from 0.19 to 0.34 M{$\oplus$}, and the system is among the most compact known among late M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets. The current data rule out planets with masses {$>$}0.57 M{$\oplus$} (with a 99\% detection probability) in Barnard's Star's habitable zone (P = 10--42 days).},

In this work we aim to determine if and how different methods for selecting populations of exoplanets for atmospheric characterization with JWST could influence population-level inferences. We generate three hypothetical surveys of super-Earths/sub-Neptunes, with each survey designed to span a similar radius-insolation flux space. The survey samples are constructed based on three different selection criteria (evenly spaced by eye, binned, and a quantitative selection function). Using an injection-recovery technique, we test how robustly individual-planet atmospheric parameters and population-level parameters can be retrieved. We find that all three survey designs result in equally suitable targets for individual atmospheric characterization, but not equally suitable targets for constraining population parameters. Only samples constructed with a quantitative method or that are sufficiently evenly spaced-by-eye result in robust population parameter constraints. Furthermore, we find that the sample with the best targets for individual atmospheric study does not necessarily result in the best-constrained population parameters. The method of sample selection must be considered. We also find that there may be large variability in population-level results with a sample that is small enough to fit in a single JWST cycle ({$\sim$}12 planets), suggesting that the most successful population-level analyses will be multicycle. Lastly, we infer that our exploration of sample selection is limited by the small number of transiting planets with measured masses around bright stars. Our results can guide future development of programs that aim to determine underlying trends in exoplanet-atmospheric properties, and, by extension, formation and evolution processes.},

Here, we offer the contrasting view that a substantial fraction of the hot Jupiter population formed in situ via the core-accretion process. We show that under conditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas accretion can be initiated by super-Earth-type planets, comprising 10--20 Earth masses of refractory material. An in situ formation scenario leads to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter than {$\sim$}100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare. High-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their detection.},

This paper presents a theoretical framework that provides a simple explanation for this phenomenon. By considering the interplay between disk accretion, magnetic field generation by convective dynamos, and Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, we derive an expression for the magnetospheric truncation radius in astrophysical disks, and find that the corresponding orbital frequency is independent of the mass of the host body. Our analysis demonstrates that this characteristic frequency corresponds to a period of \$P{\textbackslash}sim3\$ days, although intrinsic variations in system parameters are expected to introduce a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim2-3\$ spread in this result. Standard theory of orbital migration further suggests that planets should stabilize at an orbital period that exceeds disk truncation by a small margin. Cumulatively, our findings predict that the periods of close-in bodies should span \$P{\textbackslash}sim2-12\$ days - a range that is consistent with observations.},

The host star shows no signs of activity, and the kinematics hint at the star being from the thick disc population.

Nevertheless, the high cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen public interest in the results of such research requires rigorous development of experiments that can deliver a definitive advancement in our understanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a ``systems science'' approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for individual planets to make statements about their habitability and the possibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the diversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited information that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here, we propose a complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary characteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader questions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental principle of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be learned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than requiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single object. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable zone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be developed to test other foundational hypotheses in this area.},

  abstract = {Planets intermediate in size between the Earth and Neptune, and orbiting closer to their host stars than Mercury does the Sun, are the most common type of planet revealed by exoplanet surveys over the last quarter century. Results from NASA's Kepler mission have revealed a bimodality in the radius distribution of these objects, with a relative underabundance of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}backslashoplus\}\$. This bimodality suggests that sub-Neptunes are mostly rocky planets that were born with primary atmospheres a few percent by mass accreted from the protoplanetary nebula. Planets above the radius gap were able to retain their atmospheres ("gas-rich super-Earths"), while planets below the radius gap lost their atmospheres and are stripped cores ("true super-Earths"). The mechanism that drives atmospheric loss for these planets remains an outstanding question, with photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss being the prime candidates. As with the mass-loss mechanism, there are two contenders for the origins of the solids in sub-Neptune planets: the migration model involves the growth and migration of embryos from beyond the ice line, while the drift model involves inward-drifting pebbles that coagulate to form planets close-in. Atmospheric studies have the potential to break degeneracies in interior structure models and place additional constraints on the origins of these planets. However, most atmospheric characterization efforts have been confounded by aerosols. Observations with upcoming facilities are expected to finally reveal the atmospheric compositions of these worlds, which are arguably the first fundamentally new type of planetary object identified from the study of exoplanets.},

Many of these can be approached, and possibly solved, by placing organic molecular reactivity within the context of the rocks, minerals, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of a prebiotic earth. This new direction in prebiotic chemistry is discussed here, with special emphasis on the role of minerals in constraining the inherent propensity of carbohydrates to devolve to form unproductively complex mixtures of materials. We focus in particular on minerals containing the elements boron and molybdenum, which is produced in discontinuous synthesis model for the emergence of RNA as the first Darwinian molecule. Further, the role of desert environments to manage the ``water paradox'' is discussed in the context of many classes of processes that have been proposed to deliver RNA under prebiotic conditions. If current models are correct to suggest that early Earth may have been largely flooded at the time when life originated, Then those desert environments may not have been available. However, the inventory of water on Mars has always been less than on Earth and, as Kirschvink has pointed out, intercourse between the two planets was frequent during the time when life is emerging on either planets. This suggests that desert like environments may have been present on early Mars, if they were not present on early Earth.},

Our analysis also reveals the importance of including higher order effects, like microlensing parallax and planetary orbital motion even when the light curve data does not provide significant constraints on these effects. The inclusion of these effects is needed to obtain accurate estimates of the uncertainty of other microlensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius crossing time and planetary mass ratio. This will be particularly important for the exoplanet microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope, which will employ the same mass measurement method used in our analysis, using its own high angular resolution observations to determine the properties of most of its exoplanet host stars. Roman should also provide a large enough sample of exoplanetary microlens systems so that biases introduced by ignoring these higher order microlensing effects are likely to be significant.},

These observations reveal host star and planet masses of M host = 0.434 {\textpm} 0.065 M {$\odot$} and m p = 2.44 {\textpm} 0.49 M Jupiter. They are located at a distance of D L = 3.44 {\textpm} 0.53 kpc, with a projected separation of 2.70 {\textpm} 0.42 au. These results contribute to our determination of exoplanet host star masses for the Suzuki et al. statistical sample, which will determine the dependence of the planet occurrence rate on the mass and distance of the host stars. We also present a detailed discussion of the image-constrained modeling version of the eesunhong light-curve modeling code that applies high angular resolution image constraints to the light-curve modeling process. This code increases modeling efficiency by a large factor by excluding models that are inconsistent with the high angular resolution images. The analysis of this and other events from the Suzuki et al. statistical sample reveals the importance of including higher-order effects, such as microlensing parallax and planetary orbital motion, even when these features are not required to fit the light-curve data. The inclusion of these effects may be needed to obtain accurate estimates of the uncertainty of other microlensing parameters that affect the inferred properties of exoplanet microlens systems. This will be important for the exoplanet microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope, which will use both light-curve photometry and high angular resolution imaging to characterize planetary microlens systems.},

  abstract = {The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) was selected on October 19, 2012, as the first small mission (S-mission) in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched on December 18, 2019, as a secondary passenger on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. CHEOPS is a partnership between ESA and Switzerland with important contributions by ten additional ESA Member States. CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets using ultrahigh precision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a follow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly dedicated to improving, whenever possible, existing radii measurements or provide first accurate measurements for a subset of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. The expected photometric precision will also allow CHEOPS to go beyond measuring only transits and to follow phase curves or to search for exo-moons, for example. Finally, by unveiling transiting exoplanets with high potential for in-depth characterisation, CHEOPS will also provide prime targets for future instruments suited to the spectroscopic characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. To reach its science objectives, requirements on the photometric precision and stability have been derived for stars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular, CHEOPS shall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars (stellar radius of 0.9R{$\odot$}) in the magnitude range 6 {$\leq$} V {$\leq$}\,9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm in 6 hours of integration time. In the case of K-type stars (stellar radius of 0.7R{$\odot$}) of magnitude in the range 9 {$\leq$} V {$\leq$}\,12, CHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets achieving a photometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration time. This precision has to be maintained over continuous periods of observation for up to 48 hours. This precision and stability will be achieved by using a single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal plane assembly of a 33.5 cm diameter, on-axis Ritchey-Chr{\'e}tien telescope. The nearly 275 kg spacecraft is nadir-locked, with a pointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms, and will allow for at least 1 Gbit/day downlink. The sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude enables having the Sun permanently on the backside of the spacecraft thus minimising Earth stray light. A mission duration of 3.5 years in orbit is foreseen to enable the execution of the science programme. During this period, 20\% of the observing time is available to the wider community through yearly ESA call for proposals, as well as through discretionary time approved by ESA's Director of Science. At the time of this writing, CHEOPS commissioning has been completed and CHEOPS has been shown to fulfill all its requirements. The mission has now started the execution of its science programme.},

  abstract = {The dearth of planets with sizes around 1.8 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ is a key demographic feature discovered by the \$Kepler\$ mission. Two theories have emerged as potential explanations for this valley: photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss. However, Rogers et al. (2021) shows that differentiating between the two theories is possible using the three-dimensional parameter space of planet radius, incident flux, and stellar mass. We use homogeneously-derived stellar and planetary parameters to measure the \$Kepler\$ exoplanet radius gap in this three-dimensional space. We compute the slope of the gap as a function of incident flux at constant stellar mass (\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ \${\textbackslash}equiv\$ \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}log R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gap\}\} / {\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}log S {\textbackslash}right)\_\{M\_{\textbackslash}star\}\$) and the slope of the gap as a function of stellar mass at constant incident flux (\${\textbackslash}beta\$ \${\textbackslash}equiv\$ \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}log R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gap\}\} / {\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}right)\_\{S\}\$) and find \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ = 0.069\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.019\}\_\{-0.023\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ = \$-\$0.046\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.125\}\_\{-0.117\}\$. Given that Rogers et al. (2021) shows that core-powered mass-loss predicts \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 0.08 and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 0.00 while photoevaporation predicts \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 0.12 and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ --0.17, our measurements are more consistent with core-powered mass-loss than photoevaporation. However, we caution that different gap-determination methods can produce systematic offsets in both \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$; therefore, we motivate a comprehensive re-analysis of \$Kepler\$ light curves with modern, updated priors on eccentricity and mean stellar density to improve both the accuracy and precision of planet radii and subsequent measurements of the gap.},

  abstract = {New ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks allow us to probe planet formation in other planetary systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what features the Solar System protoplanetary disk could have produced during its gas phase. By running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations used as inputs for a dust evolution model, we derive synthetic images at millimeter wavelengths using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the radial gas velocities of the disk. These velocity perturbations create traffic jams in the dust, producing over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at \emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$} = 1.3 mm from these dust distributions, we show that very high resolution observations are needed to distinguish the most important features expected in the inner part ({$<$}15 AU) of the disk. The traffic jams, observable with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a system capable of producing eccentric planets by scattering events that match the eccentricity distributions in observed exoplanets does not automatically produce bright outer rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. In the second scenario, the disks do not present planet-related features at large radii. Finally, we find that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different stages of planet formation already during the first few million years, which corresponds to the gas disk phase.}},

Yet a lack of reliable Kepler detections for such planets has forced many estimates to be derived from the close-in (2 {$<$} P orb {$<$} 100 days) population, whose radii may have evolved differently under the effect of atmospheric mass-loss mechanisms. In this work, we compute the intrinsic occurrence rates of close-in super-Earths ({$\sim$}1--2 R {$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\sim$}2--3.5 R {$\oplus$}) for FGK stars (0.56--1.63 M {$\odot$}) as a function of orbital period and find evidence of two regimes: where super-Earths are more abundant at short orbital periods, and where sub-Neptunes are more abundant at longer orbital periods. We fit a parametric model in five equally populated stellar mass bins and find that the orbital period of transition between these two regimes scales with stellar mass, like . These results suggest a population of former sub-Neptunes contaminating the population of gigayear-old close-in super-Earths, indicative of a population shaped by atmospheric loss. Using our model to constrain the long-period population of intrinsically rocky planets, we estimate an occurrence rate of for Earth-sized habitable zone planets, and predict that sub-Neptunes may be {$\sim$} twice as common as super-Earths in the habitable zone (when normalized over the natural log-orbital period and radius range used). Finally, we discuss our results in the context of future missions searching for habitable zone planets.},

  abstract = {Reliable detections of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone remain elusive in the Kepler sample, even for M dwarfs. The Kepler sample was once thought to contain a considerable number of M dwarf stars (\$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\} {$<$} 4000\$ K), which hosted enough Earth-sized (\$[0.5,1.5]\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) planets to estimate their occurrence rate (\${\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) in the habitable zone. However, updated stellar properties from Gaia have shifted many Kepler stars to earlier spectral type classifications, with most stars (and their planets) now measured to be larger and hotter than previously believed. Today, only one partially-reliable Earth-sized candidate remains in the optimistic habitable zone, and zero in the conservative zone. Here we performed a new investigation of Kepler's Earth-sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars, using occurrence rate models with considerations of updated parameters and candidate reliability. Extrapolating our models to low instellations, we found an occurrence rate of \${\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}oplus=\{8.58\}\_\{-8.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+17.94\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the conservative habitable zone (and \$\{14.22\}\_\{-12.71\}{\textasciicircum}\{+24.96\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the optimistic), consistent with previous works when considering the large uncertainties. Comparing these estimates to those from similarly comprehensive studies of Sun-like stars, we found that the current Kepler sample does not offer evidence to support an increase in \${\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ from FGK to M stars. While the Kepler sample is too sparse to resolve an occurrence trend between early and mid-to-late M dwarfs for Earth-sized planets, studies including larger planets and/or data from the K2 and TESS missions are well-suited to this task.},

  abstract = {In the effort to characterize the masses, radii, and atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of such planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small as 2 R{$\oplus$} transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric variations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound observatories. Here, we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far, emphasizing the challenges they present for transit detection. We address these challenges with a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly and irregularly spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare our results to the popular box-fitting least-squares method with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.},

In its first four years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 R{$\oplus$} planet GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25 {\texttimes} 106 observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth between 2008 October and 2012 June. For 2--4 R{$\oplus$} planets, we compare this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found planets at a rate of 0.05--0.36 planets yr-1 in its first four years. As part of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600--700 K), Neptune-sized (4 R{$\oplus$}) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of {$<$}0.15 star-1 (at 95\% confidence) around MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can increase its expected planet yield by 2.5 {\texttimes} without new telescopes by shifting its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has demonstrated to be abundant.},

  abstract = {The formation of a cold Jupiter (CJ) is expected to quench the influx of pebbles and the migration of cores interior to its orbit, thus limiting the efficiency of rocky planet formation either by pebble accretion and/or orbital migration. Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs ({$>$}1 au and {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.3M Jup) correlates with the presence of inner super-Earths (at {$<$}1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of planetesimals interior to a slightly eccentric ({$\sim$}0.05) CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a viscously evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping inward through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning. This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of {$\sim$}10--100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines, making their expected collisions less destructive, due to their reduced velocity dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of {$\alpha$}-disk models (and thus disk lifetimes) and Jovian masses, peaking for values {$\sim$}1--5M Jup, which are typical of observed CJs in radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals, depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, advancement of observational capabilities, specifically the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and SPHERE instrument, alongside theoretical innovations like pebble accretion, have reshaped our understanding of planet formation and the physics of protoplanetary disks. Despite this progress, mysteries persist along the winded path of micrometer-sized dust, from the interstellar medium, through transport and growth in the protoplanetary disk, to becoming gravitationally bound bodies. This review outlines our current knowledge of dust evolution in circumstellar disks, yielding the following insights: \${\textbackslash}bullet\$ Theoretical and laboratory studies have accurately predicted the growth of dust particles to sizes that are susceptible to accumulation through transport processes like radial drift and settling. \${\textbackslash}bullet\$ Critical uncertainties in that process remain the level of turbulence, the threshold collision velocities at which dust growth stalls, and the evolution of dust porosity. \${\textbackslash}bullet\$ Symmetric and asymmetric substructure are widespread. Dust traps appear to be solving several long-standing issues in planet formation models, and they are observationally consistent with being sites of active planetesimal formation. \${\textbackslash}bullet\$ In some instances, planets have been identified as the causes behind substructures. This underlines the need to study earlier stages of disks to understand how planets can form so rapidly. In the future, better probes of the physical conditions in optically thick regions, including densities, turbulence strength, kinematics, and particle properties will be essential for unraveling the physical processes at play.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have found a valley in the size distribution of close-in super-Earths that is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are mostly rocky in composition. However, new models predict that planetesimals should first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water contents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion, planet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by their position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at or exterior to the water ice line ( ), inward migration causes planets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower final water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed and direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is thus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (\emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.3 AU) with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on the other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only migrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus constrain their migration history.}},

  abstract = {Observations point to a correlation between outer giants and inner sub-Neptunes, unexplained by simulations so far. We utilize N-body simulations including pebble and gas accretion as well as planetary migration to investigate how the gas accretion rates influence the formation of systems of inner sub-Neptunes and outer gas giants as well as the eccentricity distribution of the outer giant planets. Less efficient envelope contraction rates allow a more efficient formation of systems with inner sub-Neptunes and outer giants. This is caused by the fact that the cores formed in the inner disc are too small to accrete large envelopes and only cores growing in the outer disc can become giants. As a result, instabilities between the outer giant planets do not necessarily destroy the inner systems of sub-Neptunes unlike simulations where giant planets can form closer in. Our simulations show that up to 50\% of the systems of cold Jupiters could have inner sub-Neptunes, in agreement with observations. Our simulations show a good agreement with the eccentricity distribution of giants, even though we find a slight mismatch to the mass and semi-major axes distributions. Synthetic transit observations of the inner systems (r{$<$}0.7 AU) reveal an excellent match to the Kepler observations, where our simulations match the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs. Thus, the breaking the chains model for super-Earth and sub-Neptune formation remains consistent with observations even when outer giant planets are present. However, simulations with outer giant planets produce more systems with mostly only one inner planet and with larger eccentricities, in contrast to simulations without outer giants. We thus predict that systems with truly single close-in planets are more likely to host outer gas giants and we consequently suggest RV follow-up observations of these systems to constrain the formation pathway.},

  abstract = {Future space telescopes may be able to directly image between approximately 10 and 100 planets with sizes and orbits consistent with habitable surface conditions (``exo-Earth candidates'' or EECs), but observers will face difficulty in distinguishing these from the potentially hundreds of nonhabitable ``false positives'' which will also be detected. To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true EEC by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in the context of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct-imaging mission concepts to conduct ``mock surveys'' in which we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with {$>$}50\% confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the orbit of a given planet by revisiting the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the mass of the planet would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.},

While many evolutionary pathways are possible for inhabited worlds, a possible starting hypothesis is that most of them evolve similarly to Earth, which we propose could lead to a positive "age-oxygen correlation" between the ages of inhabited planets and the fraction which have oxygen-rich atmospheres. We demonstrate that next-generation space observatories currently under consideration could test this hypothesis, but only if the stellar age distribution of the target sample is carefully considered. We explore three possible parameterizations of the age-oxygen correlation, finding that they yield similar results. Finally, we examine how abiotic oxygen sources could affect the results, and discuss how measuring the age dependence of oxygen could shed light on whether it is a reliable biosignature. Future efforts can expand upon this groundwork by incorporating detailed models of the redox balance of terrestrial planets and its dependence on stellar and planetary properties.},

While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developed Bioverse. Bioverse combines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we apply Bioverse to determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed (Pascucci et al. 2019), we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward, Bioverse provides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.},

A comparison of the properties derived for TOI-1235 b with theoretical models reveals that the planet has a rocky composition, with a bulk density slightly higher than that of Earth.

They are assumed to have formed in situ according to the basic model that a core formed first by accretion of solid particles, then later it captured substantial amounts of gas from the protoplanetary disk. In most of the calculations we prescribe a constant accretion rate for the solid core. The evolution of the gaseous envelope is calculated according to the following assumptions: (1) it is in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, (2) the gas accretion rate is determined by the requirement that the outer radius of the planet is the place at which the thermal velocity of the gas allows it to reach the boundary of the planet's Hill sphere, (3) the gas accretion rate is limited, moreover, by the prescribed maximum rate at which the nebula can supply the gas, and (4) the growth of the planet stops once it obtains approximately the minimum mass determined from radial velocity measurements (in one case the planet is allowed to grow to twice this limit). Calculations are carried out through an initial phase during which solid accretion dominates, past the point of crossover when the masses of solid and gaseous material are equal, through the phase of rapid gas accretion, and into the final phase of contraction and cooling at constant mass. Alternative calculations are presented for the case of 47 UMa in which the solid accretion rate is calculated, not assumed, and the dissolution of planetesimals within the gaseous envelope is considered. In all cases there is a short phase of high luminosity (10-3--10-2L{$\odot$}) associated with rapid gas accretion. The height and duration of this peak depend on uncertain model parameters. The conclusion is reached that in situ formation of all of these companions is possible under some conditions. However, it is more likely that orbital migration was an important component of the evolution, at least for the planets around {$\rho$} CrB and 51 Peg.},

  abstract = {Context. Stellar populations and their distribution differ widely across the Galaxy, which is likely to affect planet demographics. Our local neighbourhood is dominated by young, metal-rich stars in the galactic thin disc, while the stellar halo and galactic bulge host a large fraction of older, metal-poor stars. Aims: We study the impact of these variations on planet populations in different regions of the Galaxy by combining a high-resolution galaxy formation simulation with state-of-the-art planet population synthesis models. Methods: We constructed a population model to estimate occurrence rates of different planet types, based on the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS). We applied this model to a simulated Milky Way (MW) analogue in the HESTIA galaxy formation simulation. We studied the planet occurrence rate in the metal-rich regions of the inner Galaxy, namely, in the galactic bulge and thin disc. We compared these result with the frequencies in the more distant, metal-poor region such as the thick disc and stellar halo. Results: We find that the planet demographics in the central, metal-rich regions of the MW analogue differ strongly from the planet populations in the more distant, metal-poor regions. The occurrence rate of giant planets ({$>$}300 M{$\oplus$}) is 10-20 times larger in the thin disc compared to the thick disc, driven by the low amounts of solid material available for planet formation around metal-poor stars. Similarly, low-mass Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars are most abundant in the thick disc, being 1.5 times more frequent than in the thin disc. Moreover, low-mass planets are expected to be abundant throughout the galaxy, from the central regions to the outer halo, due to their formation processes being less dependent on stellar metallicity. The planet populations differ more strongly around Sun-like stars compared to dwarfs with masses 0.3-0.5 M{$\odot$}, caused by a weaker correlation between [Fe/H] metallicity and planet mass. However, it is important to note that the occurrence rates of low-mass planets are still uncertain, making our findings strongly model-dependent. Massive planets are more comprehensively understood and our findings are more robust. Nonetheless, other systematic effects have the potential to alter the giant planet population that we have not addressed in this study. We discuss some of these limitations and offer further directions for future research.},

Here, we model the water loss during this pre-HZ hot phase taking into account recent upper limits on the XUV emission of UCDs and using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We address the whole range of UCDs but also focus on the planets recently found around the 0.08\,M{$\odot$} dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Despite assumptions maximizing the FUV photolysis of water and the XUV-driven escape of hydrogen, we find that planets can retain significant amount of water in the HZ of UCDs, with a sweet spot in the 0.04--0.06\,M{$\odot$} range. We also studied the TRAPPIST-1 system using observed constraints on the XUV flux. We find that TRAPPIST-1b and c may have lost as much as 15 Earth oceans and planet d -- which might be inside the HZ -- may have lost less than 1 Earth ocean. Depending on their initial water contents, they could have enough water to remain habitable. TRAPPIST-1 planets are key targets for atmospheric characterization and could provide strong constraints on the water erosion around UCDs.},

  abstract = {The habitable zone is the region around a star where standing bodies of liquid water can be stable on a planetary surface. Its width is often assumed to be dictated by the efficiency of the carbonate--silicate cycle, which has maintained habitable surface conditions on our planet for billions of years. This cycle may be inhibited by surface condensation of significant amounts of CO2 ice, which is likely to occur on distant planets containing high enough levels of atmospheric CO2. Such a process could permanently trap CO2 ice within the planet, threatening its long-term habitability. Recent work has modelled this scenario for initially cold and icy planetary bodies orbiting the Sun. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model to consider both initially warm and cold rapidly rotating planets orbiting F - K stars. We show that the range of orbital distances where significant surface CO2 ice condensation occurs is significantly reduced for warm start planets. Star type does not affect this conclusion, although surface CO2 ice condenses over a larger fraction of the habitable zone around hotter stars. The warm start simulations are thus consistent with 1D model predictions, suggesting that the classical habitable zone limits in those earlier models are still valid. We also find that the cold start simulations exhibit trends that are consistent with those of previous work for the Sun although we now extend the analysis to other star types.},

  abstract = {The exoplanet population with orbital periods \$P{$<$}100\$ d around solar-type stars is dominated by super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These planets are, however, missing in our Solar System, and the reason for that is unknown. Two theoretical scenarios invoke the role of Jupiter as the possible culprit: Jupiter may have acted as a dynamical barrier to the inward migration of sub-Neptunes from beyond the water iceline or, alternatively, may have reduced considerably the inward flux of material (pebbles) required to form super-Earths inside that iceline. Both scenarios predict an anti-correlation between the presence of small planets (SPs) and that of cold Jupiters (CJs) in exoplanetary systems. To test that prediction, we homogeneously analyzed the radial-velocity (RV) measurements of 38 Kepler and K2 transiting SP systems gathered over almost 10 years with the HARPS-N spectrograph, as well as publicly available RVs collected with other facilities. We detected five CJs in three systems, two in Kepler-68, two in Kepler-454, and a very eccentric one in K2-312. We derived an occurrence rate of \$9.3{\textasciicircum}\{+7.7\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ for CJs with \$0.3-13{\textasciitilde}M\_\{Jup\}\$ and 1-10 au, which is lower but still compatible at \$1.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ with that measured from RV surveys for solar-type stars, regardless of SP presence. This does not allow us to draw a firm conclusion about the predicted anti-correlation between SPs and CJs, which would require a considerably larger sample. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of previous claims of an excess of CJs in SP systems. As an important by-product of our analyses, we homogeneously determined the masses of 64 Kepler and K2 small planets, reaching a precision better than 5, 7.5 and 10\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ for 25, 13 and 8 planets, respectively. Finally, we release to the scientific community the 3661 HARPS-N radial velocities used in this work. [Abridged]},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, hundreds of nights have been spent on the world's largest telescopes to search for and directly detect new exoplanets using high-contrast imaging (HCI). Thereby, two scientific goals are of central interest: first, to study the characteristics of the underlying planet population and distinguish between different planet formation and evolution theories. Second, to find and characterize planets in our immediate solar neighborhood. Both goals heavily rely on the metric used to quantify planet detections and nondetections. Current standards often rely on several explicit or implicit assumptions about noise. For example, it is often assumed that the residual noise after data postprocessing is Gaussian. While being an inseparable part of the metric, these assumptions are rarely verified. This is problematic as any violation of these assumptions can lead to systematic biases. This makes it hard, if not impossible, to compare results across data sets or instruments with different noise characteristics. We revisit the fundamental question of how to quantify detection limits in HCI. We focus our analysis on the error budget resulting from violated assumptions. To this end, we propose a new metric based on bootstrapping that generalizes current standards to non-Gaussian noise. We apply our method to archival HCI data from the NACO instrument at the Very Large Telescope and derive detection limits for different types of noise. Our analysis shows that current standards tend to give detection limits that are about one magnitude too optimistic in the speckle-dominated regime. That is, HCI surveys may have excluded planets that can still exist.},

Our study aims to identify burnout profiles and highlight the corresponding job demands and resources, resulting in recommendations to reduce burnout risk in the academic context.MethodsThis cross-sectional study collected data from young researchers (n\,=\,1,123) at five Flemish universities through an online survey measuring burnout risk, work engagement, sleeping behavior, and the most prominent job demands (e.g., publication pressure) and resources (e.g., social support). We conducted Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify burnout profiles in young researchers and subsequently compared these groups on job demands and resources patterns.ResultsFive burnout profiles were identified: (1) High Burnout Risk (9.3\%), (2) Cynical (30.1\%), (3) Overextended (2.3\%), (4) Low Burnout Risk (34.8\%), and (5) No Burnout Risk (23.6\%). Each burnout profile was associated with a different pattern of job demands and resources. For instance, high levels of meaningfulness (OR\,=\,-1.96) decreased the odds to being classified in the Cynical profile.ConclusionOur findings show that the Cynical profile corresponds to a relatively high number of young researchers, which may imply that they are particularly vulnerable to the cynicism dimension of burnout. Additionally, work-life interference and perceived publication pressure seemed the most significant predictors of burnout risk, while meaningfulness, social support from supervisor and learning opportunities played an important protective role.},

  abstract = {Among the thousands of exoplanets discovered to date, approximately a few hundred gas giants on short-period orbits are classified as "lonely" and only a few are in a multi-planet system with a smaller companion on a close orbit. The processes that formed multi-planet systems hosting gas giants on close orbits are poorly understood, and only a few examples of this kind of system have been observed and well characterised. Within the contest of multi-planet system hosting gas-giant on short orbits, we characterise TOI-1130 system by measuring masses and orbital parameters. This is a 2-transiting planet system with a Jupiter-like planet (c) on a 8.35 days orbit and a Neptune-like planet (b) on an inner (4.07 days) orbit. Both planets show strong anti-correlated transit timing variations (TTVs). Furthermore, radial velocity (RV) analysis showed an additional linear trend, a possible hint of a non-transiting candidate planet on a far outer orbit. Since 2019, extensive transit and radial velocity observations of the TOI-1130 have been acquired using TESS and various ground-based facilities. We present a new photo-dynamical analysis of all available transit and RV data, with the addition of new CHEOPS and ASTEP+ data that achieve the best precision to date on the planetary radii and masses and on the timings of each transit. We were able to model interior structure of planet b constraining the presence of a gaseous envelope of H/He, while it was not possible to assess the possible water content. Furthermore, we analysed the resonant state of the two transiting planets, and we found that they lie just outside the resonant region. This could be the result of the tidal evolution that the system underwent. We obtained both masses of the planets with a precision less than 1.5\%, and radii with a precision of about 1\% and 3\% for planet b and c, respectively.},

The characteristics of the host star are well constrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of 0.970 {\textpm} 0.060 M{$\Sun$} and 0.979 {\textpm} 0.020 R{$\Sun$}. The depth of 492 {\textpm} 10 ppm for the three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 {\textpm} 0.13 Re for the planet. The system passes a battery of tests for false positives, including reconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. A full BLENDER analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretation by showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarely mimic the observed shape of the transits. The final validation of the planet is provided by 16 radial velocities (RVs) obtained with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on Keck I over a one-year span. Although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and mass determination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{$\sigma$} upper limit of 124 M{$\oplus$}, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning the designation Kepler-22b. The radiative equilibrium temperature is 262 K for a planet in Kepler-22b's orbit. Although there is no evidence that Kepler-22b is a rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius to orbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the Sun.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet demographics are sufficiently advanced to provide important constraints on theories of planet formation. While core and pebble accretion are preferred for rocky and icy planets, there appears to be a need for gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) to play a role in the formation of M-dwarf gas giants and those orbiting at large distances. Here we present GDGI models that go beyond those presented by Boss (2011) dealing with the formation of wide-orbit gas giants. The new models use quadrupled spatial resolution, in both the radial and azimuthal directions, to reduce the effects of finite spatial resolution. The new models also employ the {$\beta$} cooling approximation, instead of the diffusion approximation used by Boss (2011), in order to push the models further in time. As in Boss (2011), the central protostars have masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 M {$\odot$}, surrounded by disks with masses ranging from 0.019 M {$\odot$} to 0.21 M {$\odot$}. For each case, two models are computed, one with an initial minimum Toomre Q stability value ranging from 1.1 to 1.7, and one with a higher initial disk temperature, resulting in the initial minimum Q ranging from 2.2 to 3.4. These new models continue to show that GDGI can explain the formation of gas giants at distances of {$\sim$}30 to {$\sim$}50 au on eccentric orbits (e less than {$\sim$}0.2), though the number formed drops to 0 as the protostar mass decreases to 0.1 M {$\odot$}.},

  abstract = {The runaway greenhouse represents the ultimate climate catastrophe for rocky, Earth-like worlds: when the incoming stellar flux cannot be balanced by radiation to space, the oceans evaporate and exacerbate heating, turning the planet into a hot wasteland with a steam atmosphere overlying a possibly molten magma surface. The equilibrium state beyond the runaway greenhouse instellation limit depends on the radiative properties of the atmosphere and its temperature structure. Here, we use 1D radiative-convective models of steam atmospheres to explore the transition from the tropospheric radiation limit to the post-runaway climate state. To facilitate eventual simulations with 3D global circulation models, a computationally efficient band-gray model is developed, which is capable of reproducing the key features of the more comprehensive calculations. We analyze two factors that determine the equilibrated surface temperature of post-runaway planets. The infrared cooling of the planet is strongly enhanced by the penetration of the dry adiabat into the optically thin upper regions of the atmosphere. In addition, thermal emission of both shortwave and near-IR fluxes from the hot lower atmospheric layers, which can radiate through window regions of the spectrum, is quantified. Astronomical surveys of rocky exoplanets in the runaway greenhouse state may discriminate these features using multiwavelength observations.},

  abstract = {Non-transiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden's Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real-gas radiation, a multi-species pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme, to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0\% to 90\%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 microns. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10\% given an integration time of 24 hours, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of one week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to an easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.},

Observations favour the detection and characterisation of hot planets, potentially with large outgassed atmospheres.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We aim to determine the radius of hot Earth-like planets with large outgassing atmospheres. Our goal is to explore the differences between molten and solid silicate planets on the mass--radius relationship and transmission and emission spectra.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} An interior--atmosphere model was combined with static structure calculations to track the evolving radius of a hot rocky planet that outgasses CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} and H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O. We generated synthetic emission and transmission spectra for CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} and H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O dominated atmospheres.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Atmospheres dominated by CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} suppress the outgassing of H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O to a greater extent than previously realised since previous studies applied an erroneous relationship between volatile mass and partial pressure. We therefore predict that more H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O can be retained by the interior during the later stages of magma ocean crystallisation. Formation of a surface lid can tie the outgassing of H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O to the efficiency of heat transport through the lid, rather than the radiative timescale of the atmosphere. Contraction of the mantle, as it cools from molten to solid, reduces the radius by around 5\%, which can partly be offset by the addition of a relatively light species (e.g. H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O versus CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}) to the atmosphere.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} A molten silicate mantle can increase the radius of a terrestrial planet by around 5\% compared to its solid counterpart, or equivalently account for a 13\% decrease in bulk density. An outgassing atmosphere can perturb the total radius, according to its composition, notably the abundance of light versus heavy volatile species. Atmospheres of terrestrial planets around M-stars that are dominated by CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} or H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O can be distinguished by observing facilities with extended wavelength coverage (e.g. JWST).}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has greatly increased the number of known M-dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with Kepler data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess TESS's yield of small (0.5 R {$\oplus$} {$<$} R p {$<$} 2 R {$\oplus$}) planet candidates around nearby (d {$<$} 30 pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that, while TESS was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that TESS has detected fewer planets around stars with R {$\star$} {$<$} 0.3 R {$\odot$} than even was expected (11 observed versus 24 {\textpm} 5 expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the TESS bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are (1) the planet occurrence rate likely does not increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late-M dwarfs that still will not be detected by the end of TESS's fourth year.},

The planets orbit slightly metal-rich late F- and early G-type stars.

By combining these three data types, one can measure precise masses and sometimes orbital parameters even when the observations cover a small fraction of an orbit. The computational performance of orvara is achieved with an eccentric anomaly solver 5--10 times faster than commonly used approaches and low-level memory management to avoid Python overheads and by analytically marginalizing out parallax, barycenter proper motion, and instrument-specific radial velocity zero-points. Through its integration with the Hipparcos and Gaia intermediate astrometry package htof, orvara can properly account for the epoch astrometry measurements of Hipparcos and the measurement times and scan angles of individual Gaia epochs. We configure orvara with modifiable .ini configuration files tailored to any specific stellar or planetary system. We demonstrate orvara with a case study application to a recently discovered white dwarf/main-sequence system, HD 159062. By adding absolute astrometry to literature radial velocity and relative astrometry data, our comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis improves the precision of HD 159062B's mass by more than an order of magnitude to M {$\Sun$}. We also derive a low eccentricity and large semimajor axis, establishing HD 159062AB as a system that did not experience Roche lobe overflow.},

Here, we argue that extensive rafts of glassy, porous, and gas-rich pumice could have had a significant role in the origin of life and provided an important habitat for the earliest communities of microorganisms. This is because pumice has four remarkable properties. First, during eruption it develops the highest surface-area-to-volume ratio known for any rock type. Second, it is the only known rock type that floats as rafts at the air-water interface and then becomes beached in the tidal zone for long periods of time. Third, it is exposed to an unusually wide variety of conditions, including dehydration. Finally, from rafting to burial, it has a remarkable ability to adsorb metals, organics, and phosphates as well as to host organic catalysts such as zeolites and titanium oxides. These remarkable properties now deserve to be rigorously explored in the laboratory and the early rock record. Key Words: Pumice---Volcanoes---Biominerals---Origin of life.

We find variable signals associated with a number of astrophysical phenomena, including stellar rotation, pulsations, and multiple-star systems. The extracted variability periods are compared with stellar parameters taken from Gaia DR2, which allows us to identify distinct regions of variability in the Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram. We explore a sample of rotational main-sequence objects in period-colour space, in which we observe a dearth of rotation periods between 15 and 25\,d. This `bi-modality' was previously only seen in space-based data. We demonstrate that stars in sub-samples above and below the period gap appear to arise from a stellar population not significantly contaminated by excess multiple systems. We also observe a small population of long-period variable M-dwarfs, which highlight a departure from the predictions made by rotational evolution models fitted to solar-type main-sequence objects.

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} One of the main scenarios of planet formation is the core accretion model where a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. This core forms by accreting solids, either planetesimals or pebbles. A key constraint in this model is that the accretion of gas must proceed before the dissipation of the gas disc. Classical planetesimal accretion scenarios predict that the time needed to form a giant planet's core is much longer than the time needed to dissipate the disc. This difficulty led to the development of another accretion scenario, in which cores grow by accretion of pebbles, which are much smaller and thus more easily accreted, leading to more rapid formation.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The aim of this paper is to compare our updated pebble-based planet formation model with observations, in particular the well-studied metallicity effect.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We adopt the disc model and the pebble model and use a population synthesis approach to compare the formed planets with observations.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that keeping the same parameters as in leads to no planet growth due to a computation mistake in the pebble flux (2018b). Indeed a large fraction of the heavy elements should be put into pebbles (\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{peb{$<$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{tot{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.9) in order to form massive planets using this approach. The resulting mass functions show a huge amount of giants and a lack of Neptune-mass planets, which are abundant according to observations. To overcome this issue we include the computation of the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere in our model. This leads to the formation of Neptune-mass planets but no observable giants. Furthermore, reducing the opacity of the planetary envelope more closely matches observations.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that modelling the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere is necessary to reproduce observations.}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} In the core accretion scenario of giant planet formation, a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. In the discussion of how this core forms, some divergences appear. The first scenarios of planet formation predict the accretion of kilometre-sized bodies called planetesimals, while more recent works suggest growth by the accretion of pebbles, which are centimetre-sized objects.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} These two accretion models are often discussed separately and our aim here is to compare the outcomes of the two models with identical initial conditions.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The comparison is done using two distinct codes, one that computes the planetesimal accretion and the other the pebble accretion. All the other components of the simulated planet growth are computed identically in the two models: the disc, the accretion of gas, and the migration. Using a population synthesis approach, we compare planet simulations and study the impact of the two solid accretion models, focusing on the formation of single planets.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the outcomes of the populations are strongly influenced by the accretion model. The planetesimal model predicts the formation of more giant planets, while the pebble accretion model forms more super-Earth-mass planets. This is due to the pebble isolation mass (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{iso{$<$}sub/{$>$}) concept, which prevents planets formed by pebble accretion to accrete gas efficiently before reaching \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{iso{$<$}sub/{$>$}. This translates into a population of planets that are not heavy enough to accrete a consequent envelope, but that are in a mass range where type I migration is very efficient. We also find higher gas mass fractions for a given core mass for the pebble model compared to the planetesimal model, caused by luminosity differences. This also implies planets with lower densities, which could be confirmed observationally.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that the two models produce different outputs. Focusing on giant planets, the sensitivity of their formation differs: for the pebble accretion model, the time at which the embryos are formed and the period over which solids are accreted strongly impact the results, while the population of giant planets formed by planetesimal accretion depends on the planetesimal size and on the splitting in the amount of solids available to form planetesimals.}}}}}}}}}},

It is not assumed that the underlying distribution functions are continuous so that data with arbitrary ties can be handled. A rank test is considered where the asymptotic variance is estimated consistently by using the ranks over all observations as well as the ranks within each sample. The consistency of the estimator is derived in the appendix. For small samples (n1, n2 {$\geq$} 10), a simple approximation by a central t-distribution is suggested where the degrees of freedom are taken from the Satterthwaite-Smith-Welch approximation in the parametric Behrens-Fisher problem. It is demonstrated by means of a simulation study that the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test may be conservative or liberal depending on the ratio of the sample sizes and the variances of the underlying distribution functions. For the suggested approximation, however, it turns out that the nominal level is maintained rather accurately. The suggested nonparametric procedure is applied to a data set from a clinical trial. Moreover, a confidence interval for the nonparametric treatment effect is given.},

  abstract = {We use radial velocity observations to search for massive, long-period gas giant companions in systems hosting inner super-Earth (1-4 R\_Earth, 1-10 M\_Earth) planets in order to constrain formation and migration scenarios for this population. We consistently re-fit all published radial velocity datasets for a sample of 65 stars and find 9 systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these radial velocity data with AO images in order to constrain the allowed masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long period companions by fitting the sample with a power law distribution and find an estimated occurrence rate of 39+/-7\% for companions between 0.5-20 M\_Jup and 1-20 AU. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method and the other half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that the occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample is consistent at the 0.5sigma level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giant planets does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated with each other. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are significantly higher than those without companions, in good agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

  abstract = {The connection between outer gas giants and inner super-Earths reflects their formation and evolutionary histories. Past work exploring this link has suggested a tentative positive correlation between these two populations, but these studies have been limited by small sample sizes and in some cases sample biases. Here we take a new look at this connection with a sample of 184 super-Earth systems with publicly available radial velocity data and fully resolved outer gas giants. We calculate the frequency of outer gas giants (GG) in super-Earth (SE) systems, dividing our sample into metal-rich ([Fe/H] \${$>\$$} 0) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]\${\textbackslash}leq\$0) hosts. We find P(GG\${\textbar}\$SE, [Fe/H]\${$>\$$}0) = 28.0\${\textasciicircum}\{+4.9\}\_\{-4.6\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ and P(GG\${\textbar}\$SE, [Fe/H]\${\textbackslash}leq\$0) = 4.5\${\textasciicircum}\{+2.6\}\_\{-1.9\}{\textbackslash}\%\$. Comparing these conditional occurrence rates to field giant occurrence rates from Wittenmyer et al. 2020, we show that there is a distinct positive correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants for metal-rich host stars at the 2.5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level, but this correlation disappears for metal-poor systems. We further find that, around metal-rich stars, the GG/SE correlation enhances for systems with giants that are more distant (beyond 3 AU) and/or more eccentric (\$e {$>$} 0.2\$), while gas giant multiplicity does not appear to affect the level of correlation. Such trends again disappear around metal-poor stars with the exception of systems of multiple giants in which we observe an anti-correlation. Our findings highlight the critical role metallicity (disk solid budget) plays in shaping the overall planetary architecture.},

The formation of giant planets around low-mass stars is predicted to be rare by the core-accretion planet formation theory.

Our candidates present an exciting opportunity to improve our knowledge of the giant planet population around the lowest mass stars. We perform planet injection-recovery simulations and find that our pipeline has a high detection efficiency across the majority of our targeted parameter space. We measure the occurrence rates of giant planets with host stars in different stellar mass ranges spanning our full sample.

These tests were tuned to obtain a reasonable but arbitrary balance between catalog completeness and reliability. We produce new catalogs with differing balances of completeness and reliability by varying these tests, and study the impact of these alternative catalogs on occurrence rates. We find that if there is no correction for reliability, different catalogs give statistically inconsistent occurrence rates, while if we correct for both completeness and reliability, we get statistically consistent occurrence rates. This is a strong indication that correction for completeness and reliability is critical for the accurate computation of occurrence rates. Additionally, we find that this result is the same whether using Bayesian Poisson-likelihood Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We also examine the use of a Robovetter disposition score cut as an alternative to reliability correction, and find that while a score cut does increase the reliability of the catalog, it is not as accurate as performing a full reliability correction. We get the same result when performing a reliability correction with and without a score cut. Therefore removing low-score planets removes data without providing any advantage, and should be avoided when possible. We make our alternative catalogs publicly available, and propose that these should be used as a test of occurrence rate methods, with the requirement that a method should provide statistically consistent occurrence rates for all these catalogs.},

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

Since many dMe stars emit large amount of UV radiation during flares, in this work we analyze the UV constrains for living systems on Earth-like planets around dM stars. We apply our model of UV habitable zone (UV-HZ; Buccino, A.P., Lemarchand, G.A., Mauas, P.J.D., 2006. Icarus 183, 491--503) to the three planetary systems around dM stars (HIP 74995, HIP 109388 and HIP 113020) observed by IUE and to two M-flare stars (AD Leo and EV Lac). In particular, HIP 74995 hosts a terrestrial planet in the LW-HZ, which is the exoplanet that most resembles our own Earth. We show, in general, that during the quiescent state there would not be enough UV radiation within the LW-HZ to trigger the biogenic processes and that this energy could be provided by flares of moderate intensity, while strong flares do not necessarily rule-out the possibility of life-bearing planets.},

This study examines planet occurrence rates for the Kepler GK dwarf target sample for planet radii, 2.5 , and orbital periods, 300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough exploration and identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties. Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F0 = 0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F0 beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis. We generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase in planet occurrence rates toward small planets than previous studies of the Kepler GK dwarf sample. Through extrapolation, we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate = 0.1, with an allowed range of 2, where is defined as the number of planets per star within 20\% of the and of Earth.

As current surveys routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, models have shifted toward a more holistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here, we investigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in the statistical distribution of modeled planets. We compare the synthetic planet populations to observed exoplanets and we discuss the identified trends.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used the Generation III Bern global model of planet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations, while varying the central star from Solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes planetary migration, \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body interactions between embryos, accretion of planetesimals and gas, and the long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous atmospheres.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs (0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}--0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) and that they are more rare for Solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The reason behind this is attributed to the emergence of giant planets for \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. Given a linear scaling of the disk mass with stellar mass, the formation of Earth-like planets is limited by the available amount of solids for ultra-late M dwarfs. For \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, however, there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs, such as GJ 3512b, only form when type I migration is substantially reduced.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We are able to quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results fare well in comparison to current observational data and predict trends that can be tested with future observations.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In order to compare theoretical models with observations, the dust component has to be carefully calculated. Here, we aim to study the effects of dust entrainment in photoevaporative winds and the ejection and drag of dust due to effects caused by radiation from the central star. We improved and extended the existing implementation of a two-population dust and pebble description in the global Bern/Heidelberg planet formation and evolution model. Modern prescriptions for photoevaporative winds were used and we account for settling and advection of dust when calculating entrainment rates. In order to prepare for future population studies with varying conditions, we explore a wide range of disk-, photoevaporation-, and dust-parameters. We find that if dust can grow to pebble sizes, that is, if they are resistant to fragmentation or turbulence is weak, drift dominates and the entrained mass is small but larger than under the assumption of no vertical advection of grains with the gas flow. For the case of fragile dust shattering at velocities of 1 m/s - as indicated in laboratory experiments -, an order of magnitude more dust is entrained which becomes the main dust removal process. Radiation pressure effects disperse massive, dusty disks on timescales of a few 100 Myr. These results highlight the importance of dust entrainment in winds as a solid mass removal process. Furthermore, this model extension lies the basis for future statistical studies of planet formation in their birth environment.},

  abstract = {The radius valley (or gap) in the observed distribution of exoplanet radii, which separates smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes, is a key feature that theoretical models must explain. Conventionally, it is interpreted as the result of the loss of primordial hydrogen and helium (H/He) envelopes atop rocky cores. However, planet formation models predict that water-rich planets migrate from cold regions outside the snowline towards the star. Assuming water to be in the form of solid ice in their interior, many of these planets would be located in the radius gap contradicting observations. Here we use an advanced coupled formation and evolution model that describes the planets' growth and evolution starting from solid, moon-sized bodies in the protoplanetary disk to mature Gyr-old planetary systems. Employing new equations of state and interior structure models to treat water as vapour mixed with H/He, we naturally reproduce the valley at the observed location. The model results demonstrate that the observed radius valley can be interpreted as the separation of less massive, rocky super-Earths formed in situ from more massive, ex situ, water-rich sub-Neptunes. Furthermore, the occurrence drop at larger radii, the so-called radius cliff, is matched by planets with water-dominated envelopes. Our statistical approach shows that the synthetic distribution of radii quantitatively agrees with observations for close-in planets, but only if low-mass planets initially containing H/He lose their atmosphere due to photoevaporation, which populates the super-Earth peak with evaporated rocky cores. Therefore, we provide a hybrid theoretical explanation of the radius gap and cliff caused by both planet formation (orbital migration) as well as evolution (atmospheric escape).},

  abstract = {The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii has been compiled. It can be used to test the prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes by planet formation theory. We want to find out whether this water reservoir is included in photoevaporative winds and how much of it can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or complete segregation. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is best matched under the mixed assumption without water sequestration to the interior. We quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass. Fractionation is not found to significantly alter the composition of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. In contrast, water sequestration has a profound effect on the radius evolution and compositional budget of the planets. The model predicts the preservation of large quantities of water even if the gaseous envelope is lost. Planets with corresponding bulk densities are not observed in comparably large numbers. By combining formation and evolution model, we probe a parameter space favored by core accretion theory. We conclude that the dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps for comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction.

Professional organizations are becoming more aware of this issue, and are pursuing avenues to address it. This paper discusses the type of information, that is, useful to have on hand when writing a recommendation letter, the structure of the letter, a process to follow for proof reading, when to say no, a compilation of additional resources, and tips for people asking for recommendation letters. Specifically, we discuss common grammar mistakes, the purpose of each portion of the letter, and ways conscious and unconscious bias can influence wording and structure. This paper is intended to provide a single place where people can go to learn all of the basics needed to write a strong recommendation letter, as currently available letter writing resources in the space physics community tend to focus on one aspect of letter writing.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context\textbf{.{$<$}b/{$><$}i/{$>$} The Gl 486 system consists of a very nearby, relatively bright, weakly active M3.5 V star at just 8 pc with a warm transiting rocky planet of about 1.3 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} and 3.0 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}. It is ideal for both transmission and emission spectroscopy and for testing interior models of telluric planets.\emph{Aims\textbf{.{$<$}b/{$><$}i/{$>$} To prepare for future studies, we aim to thoroughly characterise the planetary system with new accurate and precise data collected with state-of-the-art photometers from space and spectrometers and interferometers from the ground.\emph{Methods\textbf{.{$<$}b/{$><$}i/{$>$} We collected light curves of seven new transits observed with the CHEOPS space mission and new radial velocities obtained with MAROON-X at the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope and CARMENES at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, together with previously published spectroscopic and photometric data from the two spectrographs and TESS. We also performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array and new photometric monitoring with a suite of smaller telescopes (AstroLAB, LCOGT, OSN, TJO). This extraordinary and rich data set was the input for our comprehensive analysis.\emph{Results\textbf{.{$<$}b/{$><$}i/{$>$} From interferometry, we measure a limb-darkened disc angular size of the star Gl 486 at \emph{{\texttheta}{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{LDD{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.390 {\textpm} 0.018 mas. Together with a corrected \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 parallax, we obtain a stellar radius \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{*{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} = 0.339 {\textpm} 0.015 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}. We also measure a stellar rotation period at \emph{P{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{rot{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 49.9 {\textpm} 5.5 days, an upper limit to its XUV (5-920 A) flux informed by new \emph{Hubble{$<$}i/{$>$}/STIS data, and, for the first time, a variety of element abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, V, Sr, Zr, Rb) and C/O ratio. Moreover, we imposed restrictive constraints on the presence of additional components, either stellar or sub-stellar, in the system. With the input stellar parameters and the radial-velocity and transit data, we determine the radius and mass of the planet Gl 486 b at \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 1.343\textsubscript{-0.062{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+0.063{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.00\textsubscript{-0.12{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+0.13{$<$}sup/{$>$} M\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, with relative uncertainties of the planet radius and mass of 4.7\% and 4.2\%, respectively. From the planet parameters and the stellar element abundances, we infer the most probable models of planet internal structure and composition, which are consistent with a relatively small metallic core with respect to the Earth, a deep silicate mantle, and a thin volatile upper layer. With all these ingredients, we outline prospects for Gl 486 b atmospheric studies, especially with forthcoming \emph{James Webb{$<$}i/{$>$} Space Telescope (\emph{Webb{$<$}i/{$>$}) observations.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Here, we address these inquiries using an empirical galactic simulation model to analyze the spatial--temporal variations and the prevalence of potential ETI within the Galaxy. This model estimates the occurrence of ETI, providing guidance on where to look for intelligent life in the Search for ETI (SETI) with a set of criteria, including well-established astrophysical properties of the Milky Way. Further, typically overlooked factors such as the process of abiogenesis, different evolutionary timescales, and potential self-annihilation are incorporated to explore the growth propensity of ETI. We examine three major parameters: (1) the likelihood rate of abiogenesis ({$\lambda$}A); (2) evolutionary timescales (Tevo); and (3) probability of self-annihilation of complex life (Pann). We found Pann to be the most influential parameter determining the quantity and age of galactic intelligent life. Our model simulation also identified a peak location for ETI at an annular region approximately 4 kpc from the galactic center around 8 billion years (Gyrs), with complex life decreasing temporally and spatially from the peak point, asserting a high likelihood of intelligent life in the galactic inner disk. The simulated age distributions also suggest that most of the intelligent life in our galaxy are young, thus making observation or detection difficult.},

  abstract = {Planet formation simulations are capable of directly integrating the evolution of hundreds to thousands of planetary embryos and planetesimals, as they accrete pairwise to become planets. In principle such investigations allow us to better understand the final configuration and geochemistry of the terrestrial planets, as well as to place our solar system in the context of other exosolar systems. These simulations, however, classically prescribe collisions to result in perfect mergers, but computational advances have begun to allow for more complex outcomes to be implemented. Here we apply machine learning to a large but sparse database of giant impact studies, streamlining simulations into a classi-fier of collision outcomes and a regressor of accretion efficiency. The classifier maps a 4-Dimensional parameter space (target mass, projectile-to-target mass ratio, impact velocity, impact angle) into the four major collision types: merger, "graze-and-merge", "hit-and-run", and disruption. The definition of the four regimes and their boundary is fully data-driven; the results do not suffer from any model assumption in the fitting. The classifier maps the structure of the parameter space and provides insights about the outcome regimes. The regressor is a neural network which is trained to closely mimic the functional relationship between the 4-D space of collision parameters, and a real-variable outcome, the mass of the largest remnant. This work is a prototype of a more complete surrogate model, based on extended sets of simulations ("big data"), that will quickly and reliably predict specific collision outcomes for use in realistic N-body dynamical studies of planetary formation.},

  abstract = {Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period (\$P=1.63{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{days\}\$) Jupiter-like planet (\$M\_p=1.08{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_J\}\$ and \$R\_p=0.94{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\_J\}\$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning \$0.6-5.3\$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lesssim3.0\$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2O\}\$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\_4\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2S\}\$, which have detectable molecular features between \$3.0-5.0\$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity (\${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}mathrm\{[M/H]\}{\textbackslash}sim-2\$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio (\${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}mathrm\{[C/O]\}{\textbackslash}sim3\$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20\%, which is \${\textbackslash}sim100{\textbackslash}times\$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary discs are thought to be truncated at orbital periods of around 10~d. Therefore, the origin of rocky short-period planets with P \&lt; 10~d is a puzzle. We propose that many of these planets may form through the Type-I migration of planets locked into a chain of mutual mean motion resonances. We ran N-body simulations of planetary embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disc. The embryos experienced gravitational scatterings, collisions, disc torques, and dampening of orbital eccentricity and inclination. We then modelled Kepler observations of these planets using a forward model of both the transit probability and the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline. We found that planets become locked into long chains of mean motion resonances that migrate in unison. When the chain reaches the edge of the disc, the inner planets are pushed past the edge due to the disc torques acting on the planets farther out in the chain. Our simulated systems successfully reproduce the observed period distribution of short-period Kepler planets between 1 and 2 R{$\oplus$}. However, we obtain fewer closely packed short-period planets than in the Kepler sample. Our results provide valuable insight into the planet formation process, and suggests that resonance locks, migration, and dynamical instabilities play important roles in the formation and evolution of close-in small exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Finding life on exoplanets from telescopic observations is an ultimate goal of exoplanet science. Life produces gases and other substances, such as pigments, which can have distinct spectral or photometric signatures. Whether or not life is found with future data must be expressed with probabilities, requiring a framework of biosignature assessment. We present a framework in which we advocate using biogeochemical ``Exo-Earth System'' models to simulate potential biosignatures in spectra or photometry. Given actual observations, simulations are used to find the Bayesian likelihoods of those data occurring for scenarios with and without life. The latter includes ``false positives'' wherein abiotic sources mimic biosignatures. Prior knowledge of factors influencing planetary inhabitation, including previous observations, is combined with the likelihoods to give the Bayesian posterior probability of life existing on a given exoplanet. Four components of observation and analysis are necessary. (1) Characterization of stellar (e.g., age and spectrum) and exoplanetary system properties, including ``external'' exoplanet parameters (e.g., mass and radius), to determine an exoplanet's suitability for life. (2) Characterization of ``internal'' exoplanet parameters (e.g., climate) to evaluate habitability. (3) Assessment of potential biosignatures within the environmental context (components 1--2), including corroborating evidence. (4) Exclusion of false positives. We propose that resulting posterior Bayesian probabilities of life's existence map to five confidence levels, ranging from ``very likely'' (90--100\%) to ``very unlikely'' ({$<$}10\%) inhabited.

  abstract = {The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N \${\textbackslash}geq\$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of \${\textbackslash}approx\$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions \${$<\$$}6 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.},

  abstract = {Planet formation models suggest that the small exoplanets that migrate from beyond the snowline of the protoplanetary disk likely contain water-ice-rich cores ({$\sim$}50\% by mass), also known as water worlds. While the observed radius valley of the Kepler planets is well explained by the atmospheric dichotomy of the rocky planets, precise measurements of the mass and radius of the transiting planets hint at the existence of these water worlds. However, observations cannot confirm the core compositions of those planets, owing to the degeneracy between the density of a bare water-ice-rich planet and the bulk density of a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. We combine different formation models from the Genesis library with atmospheric escape models, such as photoevaporation and impact stripping, to simulate planetary systems consistent with the observed radius valley. We then explore the possibility of water worlds being present in the currently observed sample by comparing them with simulated planets in the mass--radius--orbital period space. We find that the migration models suggest {$\greaterequivlnt$}10\% and {$\greaterequivlnt$}20\% of the bare planets, i.e., planets without primordial H/He atmospheres, to be water-ice-rich around G- and M-type host stars, respectively, consistent with the mass--radius distributions of the observed planets. However, most of the water worlds are predicted to be outside a period of 10 days. A unique identification of water worlds through radial velocity and transmission spectroscopy is likely to be more successful when targeting such planets with longer orbital periods.},

  abstract = {As the insolation of an Earth-like (exo)planet with a large amount of water increases, its surface and atmospheric temperatures also increase, eventually leading to a catastrophic runaway greenhouse transition. While some studies have shown that the onset of the runaway greenhouse may be delayed due to an overshoot of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) -- compared to the Simpson-Nakajima threshold -- by radiatively inactive gases, there is still no consensus on whether this is occurring and why. Here, we used a suite of 1D radiative-convective models to study the runaway greenhouse transition, with particular emphasis on taking into account the radical change in the amount of water vapour (from trace gas to dominant gas). The aim of this work is twofold: first, to determine the most important physical processes and parametrisations affecting the OLR; and second, to propose reference OLR curves for N\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}+H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O atmospheres. Through multiple sensitivity tests, we list and select the main important physical processes and parametrisations that need to be accounted for in 1D radiative-convective models to compute an accurate estimate of the OLR for N\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}+H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O atmospheres. The reference OLR curve is computed with a 1D model built according to the sensitivity tests. These tests also allow us to interpret the diversity of results already published in the literature. Moreover, we provide a correlated-k table able to reproduce line-by-line calculations with high accuracy. We find that the transition between an N\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}-dominated atmosphere and an H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O-dominated atmosphere induces an overshoot of the OLR compared to the (pure H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O) Simpson--Nakajima asymptotic limit. This overshoot is first due to a transition between foreign and self-broadening of the water absorption lines, and second to a transition between dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Even if their detection is for now challenging, observation of small terrestrial planets will be easier in a near future thanks to continuous improvements of detection and characterisation instruments. In this quest, climate modeling is a key step to understand their characteristics, atmospheric composition and possible history. If a surface water reservoir is present on such a terrestrial planet, an increase in insolation may lead to a dramatic positive feedback induced by water evaporation: the runaway greenhouse. The resulting rise of global surface temperature leads to the evaporation of the entire water reservoir, separating two very different population of planets: 1) temperate planets with a surface water ocean and 2) hot planets with a puffed atmosphere dominated by water vapor. In this work we use a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), the Generic-PCM, to study the runaway greenhouse transition, linking temperate and post-runaway states. Our simulations are made of two steps. First, assuming initially a liquid surface ocean, an evaporation phase which enriches the atmosphere in water vapor. Second, when the ocean is considered entirely evaporated, a dry transition phase for which the surface temperature increases dramatically. Finally, it converges on a hot and stable post-runaway state. By describing in detail the evolution of the climate during these two steps, we show a rapid transition of the cloud coverage and of the wind circulation from the troposphere to the stratosphere. By comparing our result to previous studies using 1D models, we discuss the effect of intrinsically 3D processes such as the global dynamics and the clouds, keys to understand the runaway greenhouse. We also explore the potential reversibility of the runaway greenhouse, limited by its radiative unbalance.},

  abstract = {A critical question in astrobiology is whether exo-Earth candidates (EECs) are Earth-like, in that they originate life that progressively oxygenates their atmospheres similarly to Earth. We propose answering this question statistically by searching for O2 and O3 on EECs with missions such as HabEx or LUVOIR. We explore the ability of these missions to constrain the fraction, f E, of EECs that are Earth-like in the event of a null detection of O2 or O3 on all observed EECs. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator to simulate observations of EECs with O2 and O3 levels based on Earth's history. We consider four instrument designs---LUVOIR-A (15 m), LUVOIR-B (8 m), HabEx with a starshade (4 m, ``HabEx/SS''), and HabEx without a starshade (4 m, ``HabEx/no-SS'')---as well as three estimates of the occurrence rate of EECs ({$\eta$} earth): 24\%, 5\%, and 0.5\%. In the case of a null detection, we find that for {$\eta$} earth = 24\%, LUVOIR-A, LUVOIR-B, and HabEx/SS would constrain f E to {$\leq$}0.094, {$\leq$}0.18, and {$\leq$}0.56, respectively. This also indicates that if f E is greater than these upper limits, we are likely to detect O3 on at least one EEC. Conversely, we find that HabEx/no-SS cannot constrain f E, due to the lack of a coronagraph ultraviolet channel. For {$\eta$} earth = 5\%, only LUVOIR-A and LUVOIR-B would be able to constrain f E, to {$\leq$}0.45 and {$\leq$}0.85, respectively. For {$\eta$} earth = 0.5\%, none of the missions would allow us to constrain f E, due to the low number of detectable EECs. We conclude that the ability to constrain f E is more robust to uncertainties in {$\eta$} earth for missions with larger aperture mirrors. However, all missions are susceptible to an inconclusive null detection if {$\eta$} earth is sufficiently low.},

  abstract = {Life appears to have emerged relatively quickly on the Earth, a fact sometimes used to justify a high rate of spontaneous abiogenesis ({$\lambda$}) among Earth-like worlds. Conditioned upon a single datum---the time of earliest evidence for life (tobs)---previous Bayesian formalisms for the posterior distribution of {$\lambda$} have demonstrated how inferences are highly sensitive to the priors. Rather than attempt to infer the true {$\lambda$} posterior, we here compute the relative change to {$\lambda$} when new experimental/observational evidence is introduced. By simulating posterior distributions and resulting entropic information gains, we compare three experimental pressures on {$\lambda$}: (1) evidence for an earlier start to life, tobs, (2) constraints on spontaneous abiogenesis from the laboratory, and (3) an exoplanet survey for biosignatures. First, we find that experiments 1 and 2 can only yield lower limits on {$\lambda$}, unlike 3. Second, evidence for an earlier start to life can yield negligible information on {$\lambda$} if . Vice versa, experiment 2 is uninformative when . While experiment 3 appears the most direct means of measuring {$\lambda$}, we highlight that early starts inform us of the conditions of abiogenesis and that laboratory experiments could succeed in building new life. Altogether, the three experiments are complementary, and we encourage activity in all to solve this grand challenge.},

It has revealed nearly 500 transiting planets around the ecliptic plane, many of which are the subject of further study, and over 1000 additional candidates. Here we present the results of an ongoing project to follow-up and statistically validate new K2 planets, in particular to identify promising new targets for further characterization. By analyzing the reconnaissance spectra, high-resolution imaging, centroid variations, and statistical likelihood of the signals of 91 candidates, we validate 60 new planets in 46 systems. These include: a number of planets amenable to transmission spectroscopy (K2-384 f, K2-387 b, K2-390 b, K2-403 b, and K2-398 c), emission spectroscopy (K2-371 b, K2-370 b, and K2-399 b), and both (K2-405 b and K2-406 b); several systems with planets in or close to mean motion resonances (K2-381, K2-398) including a compact, TRAPPIST-1-like system of five small planets orbiting a mid-M dwarf (K2-384); an ultra-short period sub-Saturn in the hot Saturn desert (K2-399 b); and a super-Earth orbiting a moderately bright (V=11.93), metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-0.579+/-0.080) host star (K2-408 b). In total we validate planets around 4 F stars, 26 G stars, 13 K stars, and 3 M dwarfs.

The current production of the KOI list assumes that each KOI is a single star. Not accounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets toward smaller radii. The bias toward smaller radii depends on the properties of the companion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion stars. Defining a planetary radius correction factor, XR, we find that if the KOIs are assumed to be single, then, on average, the planetary radii may be underestimated by a factor of . If typical radial velocity and high-resolution imaging observations are performed and no companions are detected, then this factor reduces to . The correction factor is dependent on the primary star properties and ranges from for A and F stars to for K and M stars. For missions like K2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler target sample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correction factor to . Finally, we show that if the stellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, then occurrence rate calculations for Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small planets by as much as 15\%--20\%.},

We describe a numerical parameterization for wavelength-dependent changes to the non-attenuated solar flux appropriate for most times and places in the solar system. We combine data from the Sun and solar analogs to estimate enhanced UV and X-ray fluxes for the young Sun and use standard solar models to estimate changing visible and infrared fluxes. The parameterization, a series of multipliers relative to the modern top of the atmosphere flux at Earth, is valid from 0.1 nm through the infrared, and from 0.6 Gyr through 6.7 Gyr, and is extended from the solar zero-age main sequence to 8.0 Gyr subject to additional uncertainties. The parameterization is applied to a representative modern day flux, providing quantitative estimates of the wavelength dependence of solar flux for paleodates relevant to the evolution of atmospheres in the solar system (or around other G-type stars). We validate the code by Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainties in stellar age and flux, and with comparisons to the solar proxies {$\kappa$}1 Cet and EK Dra.

  abstract = {Motivated by the order of magnitude difference in the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and radial velocity (RV) surveys, we present a method for comparing the statistical constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred from these methods. We first derive the mapping from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict the distribution of RV observables for the planet population inferred from microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a fiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We find that RV and microlensing surveys have some overlap, specifically for super-Jupiter mass planets (mp {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 MJup) with periods between {$\sim$}3--10 yr. However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller frequency than the overall giant planet frequency (mp {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1 MJup) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs with orbits of {$\lessequivlnt$} 30 yr.},

Using the methodology developed in the first paper, we predict the sensitivity of M-dwarf RV surveys to analogs of the population of planets inferred by microlensing. We find that RV surveys should detect a handful of super-Jovian ({$>$}MJup) planets at the longest periods being probed. These planets are indeed found by RV surveys, implying that the demographic constraints inferred from these two methods are consistent. Finally, we combine the results from both methods to estimate planet frequencies spanning wide regions of parameter space.

  abstract = {In recent years a paradigm shift has occurred in exoplanet science, wherein low-mass stars are increasingly viewed as a foundational pillar of the search for potentially habitable worlds in the solar neighborhood. However, the formation processes of this rapidly accumulating sample of planet systems are still poorly understood. Moreover, it is unclear whether tenuous primordial atmospheres around these Earth-analogs could have survived the intense epoch of heightened stellar activity that is typical for low-mass stars. We present new simulations of in-situ planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum, and derive leftover debris populations of small bodies that might source delayed volatile delivery. We then follow the evolution of this debris with high-resolution models of real systems of habitable zone planets around low-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and TOI-700. While debris in the radial vicinity of the habitable zone planets is removed rapidly, thus making delayed volatile delivery highly unlikely, we find that material ubiquitously scattered into an exo-asteroid belt region during the planet formation process represents a potentially lucrative reservoir of icy small bodies. Thus, the presence of external {\textasciitilde}Neptune-Saturn mass planets capable of dynamically perturbing these asteroids would be a sign that habitable zone worlds around low-mass stars might have avoided complete desiccation. However, we also find that such giant planets significantly limit the efficiency of asteroidal implantation during the planet formation process. In the coming decade, long-baseline radial velocity studies and Roman Space Telescope microlensing observations will undoubtedly further constrain this process.},

While it is still debated whether such a purposeful advertisement would be prudent and wise, we propose that mean-motion resonances between neighboring planets -- with orbital periods that form integer ratios -- could in principle be used to encode simple sequences that one would not expect to form in nature. In this Letter we build four multi-resonant planetary systems and test their long-term orbital stability. The four systems each contain 6 or 7 planets and consist of: (i) consecutive integers from 1 to 6; (ii) prime numbers from 2 to 11; (iii) the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 13; and (iv) the Lazy Caterer sequence from 1 to 16. We built each system using N-body simulations with artificial migration forces. We evaluated the stability of each system over the full 10 Gyr integration of the Sun's main sequence phase. We then tested the stability of these systems for an additional 10 Gyr, during and after post-main sequence evolution of the central stars (assumed to be Sun-like) to their final, white dwarf phase. The only system that was destabilized was the consecutive integer sequence (system i). The other three sequences therefore represent potential SETI beacons.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing power and numerical methodologies over the past several decades sparked a prolific output of dynamical investigations of the late stages of terrestrial planet formation. Among other peculiar inner solar system qualities, the ability of simulations to reproduce the small mass of Mars within the planets' geochemically inferred accretion timescale of {$<$}10 Myr after the appearance of calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) is arguably considered the gold standard for judging evolutionary hypotheses. At present, a number of independent models are capable of consistently generating Mars-like planets and simultaneously satisfying various important observational and geochemical constraints. However, all models must still account for the effects of the epoch of giant planet migration and orbital instability; an event which dynamical and cosmochemical constraints indicate occurred within the first 100 Myr after nebular gas dispersal. If the instability occurred in the first few Myr of this window, the disturbance might have affected the bulk of Mars' growth. In this manuscript, we turn our attention to a scenario where the instability took place after t=50 Myr. Specifically, we simulate the instability's effects on three nearly-assembled terrestrial systems that were generated via previous embryo accretion models and contain three large proto-planets with orbits interior to a collection of {\textasciitilde}Mars-mass embryos and debris. While the instability consistently triggers a Moon-forming impact and efficiently removes excessive material from the Mars-region in our models, we find that our final systems are too dynamically excited and devoid of Mars and Mercury analogs. Thus, we conclude that, while possible, our scenario is far more improbable than one where the instability either occurred earlier, or at a time where Earth and Venus' orbits were far less dynamically excited.},

  abstract = {Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M-dwarf radius valley may be well explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials and rocky planets that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away by some thermally driven mass-loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions of planets within the M-dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short-period planet TOI-1634 b (P = 0.989 days, , R {$\oplus$}) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf (K s = 8.7, R s = 0.450 R {$\odot$}, M s = 0.502 M {$\odot$}) and whose size and orbital period sit within the M-dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of M {$\oplus$}, which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky composition that is not dominated by iron and silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of Earth supports the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with M {$\odot$}.},

  abstract = {Habitability is a widely used word in the geoscience, planetary science, and astrobiology literature, but what does it mean? In this review on habitability, we define it as the ability of an environment to support the activity of at least one known organism. We adopt a binary definition of ``habitability'' and a ``habitable environment.'' An environment either can or cannot sustain a given organism. However, environments such as entire planets might be capable of supporting more or less species diversity or biomass compared with that of Earth. A clarity in understanding habitability can be obtained by defining instantaneous habitability as the conditions at any given time in a given environment required to sustain the activity of at least one known organism, and continuous planetary habitability as the capacity of a planetary body to sustain habitable conditions on some areas of its surface or within its interior over geological timescales. We also distinguish between surface liquid water worlds (such as Earth) that can sustain liquid water on their surfaces and interior liquid water worlds, such as icy moons and terrestrial-type rocky planets with liquid water only in their interiors. This distinction is important since, while the former can potentially sustain habitable conditions for oxygenic photosynthesis that leads to the rise of atmospheric oxygen and potentially complex multicellularity and intelligence over geological timescales, the latter are unlikely to. Habitable environments do not need to contain life. Although the decoupling of habitability and the presence of life may be rare on Earth, it may be important for understanding the habitability of other planetary bodies.

This review explores the environments in which active microorganisms do not occur. Within the known niche space for life, uninhabited, but habitable physical spaces potentially offer opportunities for hypothesis testing, such as using them as negative control environments to investigate the influence of life on planetary processes. At the physico-chemical limits of life, questions such as whether spaces devoid of actively metabolizing or reproducing life constitute uninhabitable space or space containing vacant niches that could be occupied with appropriate adaptation are raised. We do not know the extent to which evolution has allowed life to occupy all niche space within its biochemical potential. The case of habitable extraterrestrial environments and the scientific and ethical questions that they raise is discussed.},

We do not suggest a return to the classical, point-form significance approach to hypothesis testing. Instead we argue for an alternative distributional approach to significance testing, which addresses the observed problems with classical hypothesis testing and provides a natural link between the Bayesian and frequentist approaches.},

  abstract = {With the advent of direct imaging spectroscopy, the number of spectra from brown dwarfs and extrasolar gas giants is growing rapidly. Many brown dwarfs and extrasolar gas giants exhibit spectroscopic and photometric variability, which is likely the result of weather patterns. However, for the foreseeable future, point-source observations will be the only viable method to extract brown dwarf and exoplanet spectra. Models have been able to reproduce the observed variability, but ground truth observations are required to verify their results. To that end, we provide visual and near-infrared spectra of Jupiter and Saturn obtained from the {\textbackslash}emph\{Cassini\} VIMS instrument. We disk-integrate the VIMS spectral cubes to simulate the spectra of Jupiter and Saturn as if they were directly imaged exoplanets or brown dwarfs. We present six empirical disk-integrated spectra for both Jupiter and Saturn with phase coverage of \$1.7{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ to \$133.5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ and \$39.6{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ to \$110.2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, respectively. To understand the constituents of these disk-integrated spectra, we also provide end member (single feature) spectra for permutations of illumination and cloud density, as well as for Saturn's rings. In tandem, these disk-integrated and end member spectra provide the ground truth needed to analyze point source spectra from extrasolar gas giants and brown dwarfs. Lastly, we discuss the impact that icy rings, such as Saturn's, have on disk-integrated spectra and consider the feasibility of inferring the presence of rings from direct imaging spectra.},

It is therefore important to evaluate the effective possibility of oxygenic photosynthesis on planets around stars as a function of their spectral type and the planet--star separation. We aim at estimating the photon flux, the exergy, and the exergetic efficiency of the radiation in the wavelength range useful for the oxygenic photosynthesis as a function of the host star effective temperature and planet--star separation. We compute analytically these quantities and compare our results with the estimates for the small sample of known Earth-like planets. We find that exergy is an increasing function of the star effective temperature, within the range 2600--7200\,K. It depends both on the star--planet separation and the star effective temperature. Biospheres on exoplanets around cool stars might be generally light-limited. So far, we have not observed terrestrial planets comparable to Earth in terms of useful photon flux, exergy, and exergetic efficiency.},

So far, emission observations of individual rocky exoplanets orbiting M stars (M-Earths) have not provided definitive evidence for atmospheres. Here, we synthesize emission data for M-Earths and find a trend in measured brightness temperature (ratioed to its theoretical maximum value) as a function of instellation. However, the statistical evidence of this trend is dependent on the choice of stellar model and we consider its identification tentative. We show that this trend can be explained by either the onset of thin/tenuous atmospheres on colder worlds, or a population of bare rocks with stronger space weathering and/or coarser regolith on closer-in worlds. Such grain coarsening may be caused by sintering near the melting point of rock or frequent volcanic resurfacing. We also find that fresh, fine-grained surfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric heat redistribution. However, we argue that such surfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar System and the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies. Furthermore, we highlight considerations when testing rocky planet hypotheses at the population level, including the choice of instrument, stellar modeling, and how brightness temperatures are derived. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths will be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause.},

  abstract = {Precise mass measurements of exoplanets discovered by the direct imaging or transit technique are required to determine planet bulk properties and potential habitability. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that, for the foreseeable future, the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) measurement technique is the only method potentially capable of detecting and measuring the masses and orbits of habitable-zone Earths orbiting nearby F, G, and K spectral-type stars from the ground. In particular, EPRV measurements with a precision of better than approximately 10 cm/s (with a few cm/s stability over many years) are required. Unfortunately, for nearly a decade, PRV instruments and surveys have been unable to routinely reach RV accuracies of less than roughly 1 m/s. Making EPRV science and technology development a critical component of both NASA and NSF program plans is crucial for reaching the goal of detecting potentially habitable Earthlike planets and supporting potential future exoplanet direct imaging missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) or the Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). In recognition of these facts, the 2018 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Exoplanet Science Strategy (ESS) report recommended the development of EPRV measurements as a critical step toward the detection and characterization of habitable, Earth-analog planets. In response to the NAS-ESS recommendation, NASA and NSF commissioned the EPRV Working Group to recommend a ground-based program architecture and implementation plan to achieve the goal intended by the NAS.

In this first paper of the series, we report the discovery of low-mass stellar companions orbiting HD 53665, HD 68017, and HD 71881 using NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) observations at Keck. Follow-up imaging demonstrates association through common proper motion. These comoving companions have red colors with estimated spectral types of K7--M0, M5, and M3--M4, respectively. We determine a firm lower limit to their mass from Doppler and astrometric measurements. In the near future, it will be possible to construct three-dimensional orbits and calculate the dynamical mass of HD 68017 B and possibly HD 71881 B. We already detect astrometric orbital motion of HD 68017 B, which has a projected separation of 13.0 AU. Each companion is amenable to AO-assisted direct spectroscopy. Further, each companion orbits a solar-type star, making it possible to infer metallicity and age from the primary. Such benchmark objects are essential for testing theoretical models of cool dwarf atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The first visible-light studies of Earth-sized extrasolar planets will employ photometry or low-resolution spectroscopy. This work uses EPOCh medium-band filter photometry between 350 and 950 nm obtained with the Deep Impact (DI) High Resolution Instrument (HRI) of Earth, the Moon, and Mars in addition to previous full-disk observations of the other six solar system planets and Titan to analyze the limitations of using photometric colors to characterize extrasolar planets. We determined that the HRI 350, 550, and 850 nm filters are optimal for distinguishing Earth from the other planets and separating planets to first order based on their atmospheric and surface properties. Detailed conclusions that can be drawn about exoplanet atmospheres simply from a color--color plot are limited due to potentially competing physical processes in the atmosphere. The presence of a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere can be detected by an increase in the 350--550 nm brightness ratio, but the absence of Rayleigh scattering cannot be confirmed due to the existence of atmospheric and surface absorbing species in the UV. Methane and ammonia are the only species responsible for strong absorption in the 850 nm filter in our solar system. The combination of physical processes present on extrasolar planets may differ from those we see locally. Nevertheless, a generation of telescopes capable of collecting such photometric observations can serve a critical role in first-order characterization and constraining the population of Earth-like extrasolar planets.},

The NaCo-ISPY large program is a 120 night \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>\prime$}-band direct imaging survey aimed at investigating the giant planet population on wide orbits (\emph{a{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 10 au) around stars hosting disks.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we present the statistical analysis of a subsample of 45 young stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is the largest imaging survey uniquely focused on PPDs to date. Our goal is to search for young forming companions embedded in the disk material and to constrain their occurrence rate in relation to the formation mechanism.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used principal component analysis based point spread function subtraction techniques to reveal young companions forming in the disks. We calculated detection limits for our datasets and adopted a black-body model to derive temperature upper limits of potential forming planets. We then used Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the population of forming gas giant companions and compare our results to different types of formation scenarios.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our data revealed a new binary system (HD 38120) and a recently identified triple system with a brown dwarf companion orbiting a binary system (HD 101412), in addition to 12 known companions. Furthermore, we detected signals from 17 disks, two of which (HD 72106 and T CrA) were imaged for the first time. We reached median detection limits of \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} = 15.4 mag at 2{${''}$}.0, which were used to investigate the temperature of potentially embedded forming companions. We can constrain the occurrence of forming planets with semi-major axis \emph{a{$<$}i/{$>$} in [20--500] au and \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} in [600--3000] K to be , , and for \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 2, 3, 5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$}, which is in line with the statistical results obtained for more evolved systems from other direct imaging surveys. These values are obtained under the assumption that extinction from circumstellar and circumplanetary material does not affect the companion signal, but we show the potential impact these factors might have on the detectability of forming objects.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The NaCo-ISPY data confirm that massive bright planets accreting at high rates are rare. More powerful instruments with better sensitivity in the near- to mid-infrared are likely required to unveil the wealth of forming planets sculpting the observed disk substructures.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

HIP 99770 b is the first exoplanet ever discovered jointly through direct imaging and astrometry and the first discovery leveraging on \${\textbackslash}mu\$-arcsecond precision Gaia astrometry. HIP 99770 b is in a low-eccentricity orbit \${\textbackslash}sim\$16.9 au from the primary, receiving about as much light as Jupiter does from the Sun. The planet induces an astrometric acceleration on the host star; its directly-measured companion-to-primary mass ratio is similar to that of many radial-velocity detected planets and some of the first imaged exoplanets, including HR 8799 cde. The planet's spectrum reveals an atmosphere resembling a slightly less cloudy and likely older analogue of these first imaging discoveries, enabling a new, critical probe of how gas giant planets evolve with time. HIP 99770 b's discovery is a direct proof-of-concept for a fundamentally new strategy for finding imageable planets: selecting targets based on dynamical evidence from indirect methods like astrometry instead of conducting blind searches. This combined approach prefigures the campaigns that could one day directly detect and characterize an extrasolar Earth-like planet.},

Additional molecules may help indicate planetary habitability, rule out abiotically generated O\$\_2\$, or reveal alternative biosignatures. To understand the accessibility of environmental context using ELT spectra, we simulate high-resolution transit transmission spectra of previously-generated evolved terrestrial atmospheres. We consider inhabited pre-industrial and Archean Earth-like atmospheres, and lifeless worlds with abiotic O\$\_2\$ buildup from CO\$\_2\$ and H\$\_2\$O photolysis. All atmospheres are self-consistent with M2V--M8V dwarf host stars. Our simulations include explicit treatment of systematic and telluric effects to model high-resolution spectra for GMT, TMT, and E-ELT configurations for systems 5 and 12 pc from Earth. Using the cross-correlation technique, we determine the detectability of major species in these atmospheres: O\$\_2\$, O\$\_3\$, CH\$\_4\$, CO\$\_2\$, CO, H\$\_2\$O, and C\$\_2\$H\$\_6\$. Our results suggest that CH\$\_4\$ and CO\$\_2\$ are the most accessible molecules for terrestrial planets transiting a range of M dwarf hosts using an E-ELT, TMT, or GMT sized telescope, and that the O\$\_2\$ NIR and H\$\_2\$O 0.9 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m bands may also be accessible with more observation time. Although this technique still faces considerable challenges, the ELTs will provide access to the atmospheres of terrestrial planets transiting earlier-type M-dwarf hosts that may not be possible using JWST.},

However, the suite of atmospheric gases in terrestrial exoplanet environments that are accessible to ground-based reflected light observations has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we use an upgraded Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) detectability pipeline to simulate the detectability of gases that can serve as habitability markers, potential biosignatures, and false positive discriminants in the atmospheres of Earth-sized and sub-Neptune planets. We calculate molecular detectability for five photochemically self-consistent atmosphere types, including the modern and Archean Earth, uninhabited biosignature ``false positive'' environments, and a sub-Neptune, over a grid of observational configurations for non-transiting targets within 10pc of Earth. For the most accessible nearby target, Proxima Centauri b, our results suggest that we may be able to rule out a sub-Neptune atmosphere in as little as a single hour of observing, and two biosignature disequilibrium pairs (O\$\_2\$/CH\$\_4\$ and CO\$\_2\$/CH\$\_4\$) may be accessible in \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ hours for the most optimistic scenario.

Models assume either in situ or ex situ assembly, the latter with migration, and are evolved to the estimated age of the system, . Models combine detailed calculations of both the gaseous envelope and the condensed core structures, including accretion of gas and solids, of the disk's viscous and thermal evolution, including photo-evaporation and disk-planet interactions, and of the planet's evaporative mass loss after disk dispersal. Planet--planet interactions are neglected. Both sets of simulations successfully reproduce measured radii, masses, and orbital distances of the planets, except for the radius of Kepler 11b, which loses its entire gaseous envelope shortly after formation. Gaseous (H+He) envelopes account for \% of the planet masses, and between and \% of the planet radii. In situ models predict a very massive inner disk, whose solid surface density () varies from over 104 to at stellocentric distances . Initial gas densities would be in excess of if solids formed locally. Given the high disk temperatures (), planetary interiors can only be composed of metals and highly refractory materials. Sequestration of hydrogen by the core and subsequent outgassing is required to account for the observed radius of Kepler 11b. Ex situ models predict a relatively low-mass disk, whose initial varies from to at and whose initial gas density ranges from to . All planetary interiors are expected to be rich in H2O, as core assembly mostly occurs exterior to the ice condensation front. Kepler 11b is expected to have a steam atmosphere, and H2O is likely mixed with H+He in the envelopes of the other planets. Results indicate that Kepler 11g may not be more massive than Kepler 11e.},

  abstract = {Multiple planets undergoing disk migration may be captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances with the innermost planet parked near the disk's inner edge. Subsequent dynamical evolution may disrupt these resonances, leading to the nonresonant configurations typically observed among Kepler planets that are Gyr old. In this scenario, resonant configurations are expected to be more common in younger systems. This prediction can now be tested, thanks to recent discoveries of young planets, in particular those in stellar clusters, by NASA's TESS mission. We divided the known planetary systems into three age groups: young ({$<$}100 Myr old), adolescent (0.1--1 Gyr old), and mature ({$>$}1 Gyr old). The fraction of neighboring planet pairs having period ratios within a few percent of a first-order commensurability (e.g., 4:3, 3:2, or 2:1) is 70\% {\textpm} 15\% for young pairs, 24\% {\textpm} 8\% for adolescent pairs, and 15\% {\textpm} 2\% for mature pairs. The fraction of systems with at least one nearly commensurable pair (either first- or second-order) is 86\% {\textpm} 13\% among young systems, 38\% {\textpm} 12\% for adolescent systems, and 23\% {\textpm} 3\% for mature systems. First-order commensurabilities prevail across all age groups, with an admixture of second-order commensurabilities. Commensurabilities are more common in systems with high planet multiplicity and low mutual inclinations. Observed period ratios often deviate from perfect commensurability by {$\sim$}1\% even among young planets, too large to be explained by resonant repulsion with equilibrium eccentricity tides. We also find that super-Earths in the radius gap (1.5--1.9R {$\oplus$}) are less likely to be near-resonant (11.9\% {\textpm} 2.0\%) compared to Earth-sized planets (R p {$<$} 1R {$\oplus$}; 25.3\% {\textpm} 4.4\%) or mini-Neptunes (1.9R {$\oplus$} {$\leq$} R p {$<$} 2.5R {$\oplus$}; 14.4\% {\textpm} 1.8\%).},

No such planet is a member of the Solar System, yet they appear to be abundant in the local neighbourhood. Their internal structure is not well understood. Super Earths presumably are rocky planets with a thin secondary atmosphere, whereas gas dwarfs have a substantial (by volume) primary H/He atmosphere. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the presence of a third class of planets, so-called water worlds, which are hypothesised to contain a significant mass fraction of water in condensed or steam form. This study examines the evidence for water worlds and presents a sample of 60 precisely measured small exoplanets (less than 4 Earth radii) orbiting M dwarf stars. We combine observational data and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to classify these planets based on their mass, radius, and density. We individually model the interior of each planet using the ExoMDN code and classify them into populations based on these models. Our findings indicate that the sample divides into two distinct planet populations, with no clear evidence supporting the existence of water worlds in the current dataset.},

In order to quantify the science potential of such a mission, in particular in the context of technical trade-offs, an instrument simulator is required. In addition, signal extraction algorithms are needed to verify that exoplanet properties (e.g., angular separation, spectral flux) contained in simulated exoplanet datasets can be accurately retrieved. We present LIFEsim, a software tool developed for simulating observations of exoplanetary systems with an MIR space-based nulling interferometer. It includes astrophysical noise sources (i.e., stellar leakage and thermal emission from local zodiacal and exo-zodiacal dust) and offers the flexibility to include instrumental noise terms in the future. LIFEsim provides an accessible way for predicting the expected SNR of future observations as a function of various key instrument and target parameters. The SNRs of the extracted spectra are photon-noise dominated, as expected from our current simulations. From single epoch observations in our mock survey of small (\$R {$<$} 1.5 R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Earth\}\$) planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their stars, we find that typical uncertainties in the estimated effective temperature of the exoplanets are \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$10\%, for the exoplanet radius \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$20\%, and for the separation from the host star \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$2\%. SNR values obtained in the signal extraction process deviate less than 10\% from purely photon-counting statistics based SNRs. (abridged)},

  abstract = {The Kepler mission enabled us to look at the intrinsic population of exoplanets within our galaxy. In period-radius space, the distribution of the intrinsic population of planets contains structure that can trace planet formation and evolution history. The most distinctive feature in period-radius space is the radius cliff, a steep drop-off in occurrence between \$2.5-4\$R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ across all period ranges, separating the sub-Neptune population from the rarer Neptunes orbiting within 1 au. Following our earlier work to measure the occurrence rate of the Kepler population, we characterize the shape of the radius cliff as a function of orbital period (\$10-300\$ days) as well as insolation flux (9500S\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ -- 10S\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$). The shape of the cliff flattens at longer orbital periods, tracking the rising population of Neptune-sized planets. In insolation, however, the radius cliff is both less dramatic and the slope is more uniform. The difference in this feature between period- and insolation-space can be linked to the effect of EUV/X-ray versus bolometric flux in the planet's evolution. Models of atmospheric mass loss processes that predict the location and shape of the radius valley also predict the radius cliff. We compare our measured occurrence rate distribution to population synthesis models of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss in order to constrain formation and evolution pathways. We find that the models do not statistically agree with our occurrence distributions of the radius cliff in period- or insolation-space. Atmospheric mass loss that shapes the radius valley cannot fully explain the shape of the radius cliff.},

  abstract = {The discovery of Earth-like planets is a major focus of current planetology research and faces a significant technological challenge. Indeed, when it comes to detecting planets as small and cold as the Earth, the cost of observation time is massive. Understanding in what type of systems Earth-like planets (ELPs) form and how to identify them is crucial for preparing future missions such as PLATO, LIFE, or others. Theoretical models suggest that ELPs predominantly form within a certain type of system architecture. Therefore, the presence or absence of ELPs could be inferred from the arrangement of other planets within the same system. This study aims to identify the profile of a typical system that harbours an ELP by investigating the architecture of systems and the properties of their innermost detectable planets. Here, we introduce a novel method for determining the architecture of planetary systems and categorising them into four distinct classes. Using three populations of synthetic planetary systems generated using the Bern model around three different types of stars, we studied the `theoretical' architecture (the architecture of a complete planetary system) and the `biased' architecture (the architecture of a system in which only detectable planets are taken into account) of the synthetic systems. The biased architecture of a system, studied in conjunction with the mass, radius, and period of the innermost detectable planet, appears to correlate with the presence or absence of an ELP in the same system. We conclude that the detections of ELPs can be predicted thanks to the already known properties of their systems, and we present a list of the properties of the systems most likely to host such a planet.},

Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes radial-velocity follow-up of most. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian method of measuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light curve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit durations---part of the ``photoeccentric'' light curve signature of a planet's eccentricity---even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and loosely constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity of e = 0.71+0.16- 0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e = 0.67 {\textpm} 0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional tests using Kepler data. In each case, the technique proves to be a viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto-hot Jupiters predicted by Socrates et al.},

Recent flybys of Enceladus by the Cassini probe have confirmed the existence of a long-lived global ocean laced with organic compounds and biologically available nitrogen. This immediately suggests the possibility that life could have begun and may still exist on Enceladus. Here we will compare the properties of two proposed sites for the origin of life on Earth---hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor and hydrothermal volcanic fields at the surface---and ask whether similar conditions could have fostered the origin of life on Enceladus. The answer depends on which of the two sites would be more conducive for the chemical evolution leading to life's origin. A hydrothermal vent origin would allow life to begin in the Enceladus ocean, but if the origin of life requires freshwater hydrothermal pools undergoing wet-dry cycles, the Enceladus ocean could be habitable but lifeless. These arguments also apply directly to Europa and indirectly to early Mars. Key Words: Enceladus---Hydrothermal vents---Hydrothermal fields---Origin of life. Astrobiology 17, 834--839.},

Because life today thrives not just in the temperate ocean and lakes but also in extreme conditions of temperature, salinity, and pH, there is a general assumption that any form of liquid water would be sufficient to support the origin of life as long as there are sources of chemical energy and simple organic compounds. We argue here that the first forms of life would be physically and chemically fragile and would be strongly affected by ionic solutes and pH. A hypothesis emerges from this statement that hot springs associated with volcanic land masses have an ionic composition more conducive to self-assembly and polymerization than seawater. Here we have compared the ionic solutes of seawater with those of terrestrial hot springs. We then describe preliminary experimental results that show how the hypothesis can be tested in a prebiotic analog environment.},

  abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS is currently ambiguous because different observational groups claim different results from the same data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with HST/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD 209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6\% (XO-1) and 26\% (HD 209458b) of the photon-limit at a resolving power of {$\lambda$}/{$\delta\lambda$} {$\sim$} 70, and are better than 0.01\% per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 {$\mu$}m. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD 209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. Model atmospheres having uniformly distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm2 g-1 account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption. Our results for HD 209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD 209458b is grayer than for HD 189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},

This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system, as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss, so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface, where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels, by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate, concluding that deployment over 10\% of the Arctic, especially where ice survival is marginal, could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic, using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multipronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system.},

Despite not being peer-reviewed, this uploaded manuscript has been reported by media outlets as "published", and its conclusions have been widely distributed as fact. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide potential peer reviewers and the general public with an appreciation of the multiple fatal flaws with the manuscript's arguments. We discuss the published evidence that the 2014-01-08 bolide is not interstellar. We show that there is no statistical spatial correlation of a chemical signature or even number of recovered spherules with the 2014-01-08 bolide. We demonstrate that the Fe isotopic ratios decisively indicate an origin in our Solar System, with {$>$} 99.995\% probability. We demonstrate that the unusual enrichments in La, U, etc., have in fact been observed in micrometeorites before and attributed to terrestrial contamination; and that the Be abundances are similarly consistent with those of ferromanganese nodules, after reacting with sea water. Far from being exotic particles from an extrasolar planet, the spherules collected and analyzed by Loeb et al. appear to be just like those found around the world, with a Solar System origin and compositions modified by tens of thousands of years residence at the ocean bottom.},

The fundamental question is whether these close-in low-mass planets could have formed in the inner disk interior to 1 au, or whether they formed further out in the planet-forming disk and migrated inward. Exploring the role of additional giant planet(s) in these systems may help us to pinpoint their global formation and evolution.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We searched for additional substellar companions by using direct imaging in systems known to host close-in small planets. The use of direct imaging complemented by radial velocity and astrometric detection limits enabled us to explore the giant planet and brown dwarf demographics around these hosts to investigate the potential connection between both populations.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We carried out a direct imaging survey with SPHERE at VLT to look for outer giant planets and brown dwarf companions in 27 systems hosting close-in low-mass planets discovered by radial velocity. Our sample is composed of very nearby ({$<$}20 pc) planetary systems, orbiting G-, K-, and M-type mature (0.5--10 Gyr) stellar hosts. We performed homogeneous direct imaging data reduction and analysis to search for and characterize point sources, and derived robust statistical detection limits. The final direct imaging detection performances were globally considered together with radial velocity and astrometric sensitivity.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Of 337 point-source detections, we do not find any new bound companions.

  abstract = {The major goals of NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and the European Space Agency's Darwin missions are to detect terrestrial-sized extrasolar planets directly and to seek spectroscopic evidence of habitable conditions and life. Here we recommend wavelength ranges and spectral features for these missions. We assess known spectroscopic molecular band features of Earth, Venus, and Mars in the context of putative extrasolar analogs. The preferred wavelength ranges are 7-25 {$\mu$}m in the mid-IR and 0.5 to {\textasciitilde}1.1 {$\mu$}m in the visible to near-IR. Detection of O2 or its photolytic product O3 merits highest priority. Liquid H2O is not a bioindicator, but it is considered essential to life. Substantial CO2 indicates an atmosphere and oxidation state typical of a terrestrial planet. Abundant CH4 might require a biological source, yet abundant CH4 also can arise from a crust and upper mantle more reduced than that of Earth. The range of characteristics of extrasolar rocky planets might far exceed that of the Solar System. Planetary size and mass are very important indicators of habitability and can be estimated in the mid-IR and potentially also in the visible to near-IR. Additional spectroscopic features merit study, for example, features created by other biosignature compounds in the atmosphere or on the surface and features due to Rayleigh scattering. In summary, we find that both the mid-IR and the visible to near-IR wavelength ranges offer valuable information regarding biosignatures and planetary properties; therefore both merit serious scientific consideration for TPF and Darwin.},

K2-3b and c are consistent with rocky cores surrounded by solar composition envelopes (mass fractions of 0.36\% and 0.07\%), H2O envelopes (55\% and 16\%), or a mixture of both. However, based on the high-energy output and estimated age of K2-3, it is unlikely that K2-3b and c retain solar composition atmospheres. We pass the planet parameters and high-energy stellar spectrum to atmospheric models. Dialing the high-energy spectrum up and down by a factor of 10 produces significant changes in trace molecule abundances, but not at a level detectable with transmission spectroscopy. Though the K2-3 planets span the small planet radius valley, the observed system architecture cannot be readily explained by photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. We instead propose 1) the K2-3 planets are all volatile-rich, with K2-3d having a lower density than typical of super-Earths, and/or 2) the K2-3 planet architecture results from more stochastic processes such as planet formation, planet migration, and impact erosion.},

  abstract = {The minimum orbital separation of planets in long-stable planetary systems is often modeled as a step function, parameterized with a single value \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{min\}\$ (measured in mutual Hill radius of the two neighboring planets). Systems with smaller separations are considered unstable, and planet pairs with greater separations are considered stable. Here we report that a log-normal distribution function for \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{min\}\$, rather than a single threshold value, provides a more accurate model. From our suite of simulated planetary systems, the parameters of the best-fit log-normal distribution are \${\textbackslash}mu=1.97{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma=0.40{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$, such that the mean, median, and mode of \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{min\}\$ are 7.77, 7.17, and 6.11, respectively. This result is consistent with previous estimates for \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{min\}\$ threshold values in the range \${\textbackslash}sim\$5\$-\$8. We find a modest dependence of the distribution of \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{min\}\$ on multiplicity within the system, as well as on planetary mass ratios of the closest planet pair. The overall distribution of nearest-neighbor planetary orbital spacings (measured in the mutual Hill radii and denoted simply as \${\textbackslash}Delta\$) in long-term stable systems is also well fit with a log-normal distribution, with parameters \${\textbackslash}mu=3.14{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma=0.76{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$. In simulations of sets of many planets initially packed very close together, we find that the orbital spacings of long-term stable systems is statistically similar to that in the observed Kepler sample of exo-planetary systems, indicating a strong role of sculpting of planetary architectures by dynamical instabilities.},

The radial surface brightness profile is measured down to {$\mu$}g {$\sim$} 32 mag arcsec-2, a depth that approaches the sensitivity of star count studies in the Local Group. We convert surface brightness to surface mass density using the radial g - r color profile. The mass density profile shows no significant upturn at large radius and is well-approximated by a simple bulge + disk model out to R = 70 kpc, corresponding to 18 disk scale lengths. Fitting a bulge + disk + halo model we find that the best-fitting halo mass M{$\Sun$}. The total stellar mass of M101 is M{$\Sun$}, and we infer that the halo mass fraction . This mass fraction is lower than that of the Milky Way (fhalo {$\sim$} 0.02) and M31 (fhalo {$\sim$} 0.04). All three galaxies fall below the fhalo--Mtot, * relation predicted by recent cosmological simulations that trace the light of disrupted satellites, with M101's halo mass a factor of {$\sim$}10 below the median expectation. However, the predicted scatter in this relation is large, and more galaxies are needed to better quantify this possible tension with galaxy formation models. Dragonfly is well suited for this project: as integrated-light surface brightness is independent of distance, large numbers of galaxies can be studied in a uniform way.},

We address the crucial question of whether the seven Earth-sized planets transiting the recently discovered ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 are capable of retaining their atmospheres. To this effect, we carry out numerical simulations to characterize the stellar wind of TRAPPIST-1 and the atmospheric ion escape rates for all of the seven planets. We also estimate the escape rates analytically and demonstrate that they are in good agreement with the numerical results. We conclude that the outer planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system are capable of retaining their atmospheres over billion-year timescales. The consequences arising from our results are also explored in the context of abiogenesis, biodiversity, and searches for future exoplanets. In light of the many unknowns and assumptions involved, we recommend that these conclusions must be interpreted with due caution.},

  abstract = {Interior characterization traditionally relies on individual planetary properties, ignoring correlations between different planets of the same system. For multiplanetary systems, planetary data are generally correlated. This is because the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute planetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to the multiplanetary system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our understanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky interior of planets in a multiplanetary system can be preferentially probed by studying the densest planet representing a rocky interior analog. Our methodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated variability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water oceans, and ice layers, as well as a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior estimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) the importance of interdependent planetary data for interior characterization is comparable to changes in data precision by 30\%. For the interiors of TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range from 0\% to 25\%. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or planet mass challenges possible formation scenarios. While our estimates change relatively little with data precision, they critically depend on data accuracy. If planetary masses varied within {\textpm}24\%, interiors would be consistent with uniform ({$\sim$}7\%) or an increasing water mass fractions with orbital period ({$\sim$}2\%-12\%).},

Such differences in the observed bulk density of planets may occur as a function of radial location and time of planet formation. In this work, we show that the predicted differences are on the cusp of being detectable with current instrumentation. In fact, for HD 219134, the 10~per\,cent lower bulk density of planet b compared to planet c could be explained by enhancements in Ca-, Al-rich minerals. However, we also show that the 11~per\,cent uncertainties on the individual bulk densities are not sufficiently accurate to exclude the absence of a density difference as well as differences in volatile layers. Besides HD 219134 b, we demonstrate that 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e are similar candidates of a new Super-Earth class that have no core and are rich in Ca and Al minerals that are among the first solids that condense from a cooling proto-planetary disc. Planets of this class have densities 10--20~per\,cent lower than Earth-like compositions and may have very different interior dynamics, outgassing histories, and magnetic fields compared to the majority of Super-Earths.},

Here we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a fixed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within the current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level. Unrecognized mantle melting and volatile redistribution in retrievals may thus underestimate the inferred planetary bulk water content by up to 1 order of magnitude.},

It uses a monolithic primary mirror of borosilicate glass, drawing on lessons and tools from decades of experience with ground-based observatories and instruments, as well as flagship space missions. It takes advantage, as do large launch vehicles, of increased computing power and space-worthy commercial electronics in low-cost active predictive control systems to maintain stability.

We build on past thermal-orbital models and incorporate the evolution of the lunar figure including a fossil figure component. Obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean would have produced rapid inclination damping, making it difficult for an early inclination to survive to the present-day. An early inclination is preserved only if the solid-body of the early Moon were less dissipative than at present. If instabilities at the Laplace plane transition were the source of the inclination, then the Moon had to recede slowly, which is consistent with previous findings of a weakly dissipative early Earth. If collisionless encounters with planetesimals up to 140 Myr after Moon formation excited the inclination, then the Moon had to migrate quickly to pass through the Cassini state transition at 33 Earth radii and reach a period of limited inclination damping. The fossil figure was likely established before 16 Earth radii to match the present-day degree-2 gravity field observations.},

We exploit the elemental abundances observed in six white dwarfs polluted by the accretion of rocky bodies to determine the fraction of oxidized iron in those extrasolar rocky bodies and therefore their oxygen fugacities.

This latter factor means that the approximately 6 TB of data collected annually must be processed on site automatically, with only final data products being sent once a day to Europe. In this context, we present the current state of operations of ASTEP+, a 40 cm optical telescope located at Concordia Station in Antarctica. Following a successful summer campaign, ASTEP+ has begun the 2022 observing season with a brand-new two-colour photometer with increased sensitivity. A new Python data analysis pipeline installed on a dedicated server in Concordia will significantly improve the precision of the extracted photometry, enabling us to get higher signal-to-noise transit detections. The new pipeline additionally incorporates automatic transit modelling to reduce the amount of manual post-processing required. It also handles the automatic daily transfer of the photometric lightcurves and control data to Europe. Additionally, we present the Python and web-based systems used for selection and scheduling of transit observations; these systems have wide applicability for the scheduling of other astronomical observations with strong time constraints. We also review the type of science that ASTEP+ will be conducting and analyse how unique ASTEP+ is to exoplanet transit research.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of planet formation has been rapidly evolving in recent years. The classical planet formation theory, developed when the only known planetary system was our own Solar System, has been revised to account for the observed diversity of the exoplanetary systems. At the same time, the increasing observational capabilities of the young stars and their surrounding disks bring new constraints on the planet formation process. In this chapter, we summarize the new information derived from the exoplanets population and the circumstellar disks observations. We present the new developments in planet formation theory, from dust evolution to the growth of planetary cores by accretion of planetesimals, pebbles, and gas. We review the state-of-the-art models for the formation of diverse planetary systems, including the population synthesis approach which is necessary to compare theoretical model outcomes to the exoplanet population. We emphasize that the planet formation process may not be spatially uniform in the disk and there are preferential locations for the formation of planetesimals and planets.

  abstract = {Our understanding of the planet formation has been rapidly evolving in recent years. The classical planet formation theory, developed when the only known planetary system was our own Solar System, has been revised to account for the observed diversity of the exoplanetary systems. At the same time, the increasing observational capabilities of the young stars and their surrounding disks bring new constraints on the planet formation process. In this chapter, we summarize the new information derived from the exoplanets population and the circumstellar disks observations. We describe the new developments in planet formation theory, from dust evolution to the growth of planetary cores by accretion of planetesimals, pebbles, and gas. We review the state-of-the-art models for the formation of diverse planetary systems, including the population synthesis approach which is necessary to compare theoretical model outcomes to the exoplanet population. We emphasize that the planet formation process may not be spatially uniform in the disk and there are preferential locations for the formation of planetesimals and planets. Outside of these locations, a significant fraction of solids is not growing past the pebble-sizes. The reservoir of pebbles plays an important role in the growth of planetary cores in the pebble accretion process. The timescale of the emergence of massive planetary cores is an important aspect of the present models and it is likely that the cores within one disk form at different times. In addition, there is growing evidence that the first planetary cores start forming early, during the circumstellar disk buildup process.},

  abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and super-Earths (1.5-2 R{$\oplus$}) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R{$\oplus$} and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 {\textpm} 0.4 pc and pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 {\textpm} 0.2 pc and pc.},

It presents 5 scenarios: (a) a ``business as usual'' approach, which leads to exponential accumulation and growing rate of satellite losses, but no catastrophic chain reaction; (b) a conflict with a large-scale deployment of antisatellite weapons, leading to an accelerated accumulation and losses, but still no chain reaction; (c) electromagnetic pulse scenario modeling loss of control over satellites en masse; (d) cessation of all low earth orbit (LEO) satellite launches, illustrating high inertia of the system, which continues to produce more debris; and (e) scenario representing an attempt to mitigate the situation via direct removal of some portion of inactive satellites from the LEO. All scenarios take place in 2040. The article demonstrates the gravity of the situation and the necessity for a sustainable long-term solution, as orbital debris poses a threat to our future space operation even without triggering a catastrophic chain reaction.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} With more than 1000 h of observation from Feb. 2016 to Oct. 2019, the \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$} Exploration Program Red Worlds (ID: 13067, 13175 and 14223) exclusively targeted TRAPPIST-1, a nearby (12 pc) ultracool dwarf star, finding that it is orbited by seven transiting Earth-sized planets. At least three of these planets orbit within the classical habitable zone of the star, and all of them are well-suited for a detailed atmospheric characterization with the upcoming JWST.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The main goals of the \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$} Red Worlds program were (1) to explore the system for new transiting planets, (2) to intensively monitor the planets' transits to yield the strongest possible constraints on their masses, sizes, compositions, and dynamics, and (3) to assess the infrared variability of the host star. In this paper, we present the global results of the project.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We analyzed 88 new transits and combined them with 100 previously analyzed transits, for a total of 188 transits observed at 3.6 or 4.5 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m. For a comprehensive study, we analyzed all light curves both individually and globally. We also analyzed 29 occultations (secondary eclipses) of planet b and eight occultations of planet c observed at 4.5 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m to constrain the brightness temperatures of their daysides.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We identify several orphan transit-like structures in our \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$} photometry, but all of them are of low significance. We do not confirm any new transiting planets. We do not detect any significant variation of the transit depths of the planets throughout the different campaigns. Comparing our individual and global analyses of the transits, we estimate for TRAPPIST-1 transit depth measurements mean noise floors of {\textasciitilde}35 and 25 ppm in channels 1 and 2 of \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$}/IRAC, respectively. We estimate that most of this noise floor is of instrumental origins and due to the large inter-pixel inhomogeneity of IRAC InSb arrays, and that the much better interpixel homogeneity of JWST instruments should result in noise floors as low as 10 ppm, which is low enough to enable the atmospheric characterization of the planets by transit transmission spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a few outlier transits, but we cannot conclude whether or not they correspond to spot or faculae crossing events. We construct updated broadband transmission spectra for all seven planets which show consistent transit depths between the two \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$} channels. Although we are limited by instrumental precision, the combined transmission spectrum of planet b to g tells us that their atmospheres seem unlikely to be CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$}-dominated. We identify and model five distinct high energy flares in the whole dataset, and discuss our results in the context of habitability. Finally, we fail to detect occultation signals of planets b and c at 4.5 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m, and can only set 3-\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$} upper limits on their dayside brightness temperatures (611 K for b 586 K for c).}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The first James Webb Space Telescope/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15\,{$\mu$}m, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15\,{$\mu$}m were acquired as part of Guaranteed Time Observer time that included a twin programme at 12.8\,{$\mu$}m to obtain measurements inside and outside the CO2 absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8\,{$\mu$}m. We perform a global fit of the ten eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1{$\sigma$} error of 452 {\textpm}\,86\,ppm and 775 {\textpm}\,90\,ppm at 12.8\,{$\mu$}m and 15\,{$\mu$}m, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes, fits the data well. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2 atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2 feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet's atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.},

  abstract = {Context: Recent observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that the large dust aggregates observed at millimeter wavelengths settle to the midplane into a remarkably thin layer. Aims: We intend to find out if the geometric thinness of these layers is evidence against the vertical shear instability (VSI) operating in these disks. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a locally isothermal equation of state, and let the VSI fully develop. We sprinkled dust particles and followed their motion as they got stirred up by the VSI. We determined for which grain size the layer becomes geometrically thin enough to be consistent with ALMA observations. We then verified if, with these grain sizes, it is still possible to generate a moderately optically thick layer at millimeter wavelengths, as observations appear to indicate. Results: We found that even very large dust aggregates with Stokes numbers close to unity get stirred up to relatively large heights above the midplane by the VSI, which is in conflict with the observed geometric thinness. For grains so large that the Stokes number exceeds unity, the layer can be made to remain thin, but we show that it is hard to make dust layers optically thick at ALMA wavelengths (e.g., tau(1.3mm){$>$}=1) with such large dust aggregates. Conclusions: We conclude that protoplanetary disks with geometrically thin midplane dust layers cannot be VSI unstable, at least not down to the disk midplane. Explanations for the inhibition of the VSI include a reduced dust-to-gas ratio of the small dust grains that are responsible for the radiative cooling of the disk. A reduction of small grains by a factor of between 10 and 100 is sufficient to quench the VSI. Such a reduction is plausible in dust growth models, and still consistent with observations at optical and infrared wavelengths.},

As the approaching catastrophe has never looked so alarming, the amount of scientific knowledge about the bioclimatic crisis is still rising exponentially. Here we reflect on how researchers in ecology or climate science behave amid this crisis. In face of the disproportionality between how much scientists know and how little they engage, we discuss four barriers that may underlie the decoupling of scientific awareness from concrete action. We then reflect on the potency of rational thinking to trigger engagement on its own, and question whether more scientific knowledge can be the tipping point towards radical changes within society. Our observations challenge the tenet that a better understanding of what surrounds us is necessary to protect it efficiently. With the environmental cost of scientific research itself as an additional factor that must be considered, we suggest there is an urgent need for researchers to collectively reflect on their situation and decide how to redirect their actions.},

Our detailed analyses are based on literature HIRES data and newly obtained HARPS and CARMENES radial-velocity (RV) measurements as part of our survey in search for additional planets around single-planet systems. We perform a periodogram analysis of the available HIRES and HARPS precise RVs and stellar activity indicators. We do not find any apparent correlation between the RV measurements and the stellar activity indicators, thus linking the two strong periodicities to a moderately compact multiplanet system. We carry out orbital fitting analysis by testing various one- and two-planet orbital configurations and studying the posterior probability distribution of the fitted parameters. Our results solidify the existence of a Saturn-mass planet (HD 107148b, discovered first) with a period of P b {$\sim$} 77.2 days and a second, eccentric (e c {$\sim$} 0.4), Neptune-mass exoplanet (HD 107148c) with an orbital period of P c {$\sim$} 18.3 days. Finally, we investigate the two-planet system's long-term stability and overall orbital dynamics with the posterior distribution of our preferred orbital configuration. Our N-body stability simulations show that the system is long-term stable and exhibits large secular osculations in eccentricity but in no particular mean motion resonance configuration. The HD 107148 system, consisting of a solar-type main-sequence star with two giant planets in a rare configuration, features a common proper-motion white dwarf companion and is therefore a valuable target for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {We use a carefully selected subsample of 1053 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to construct empirical power-law exoplanet mass-radius-temperature (\$M\$-\$R\$-\$T\$) relations. Using orthogonal distance regression to account for errors in both mass and radius, we allow the data to decide: 1) the number of distinct planetary regimes; 2) whether the boundaries of these regimes are best described by broken power laws joined at mass break points, or by discontinuous power laws motivated by changes in equations of state and temperature. We find strong support from the data for three distinct planetary \$M\$-\$R\$ regimes and for those regimes to be discontinuous. Our most successful model involves an \$M\$-\$R\$-\$T\$ relation in which ice/rock (rocky) and ice-giant (neptunian) planets are segregated by a pure-ice equation of state, whilst neptunes and gas giant (jovian) planets are segregated by a mass break at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm br\} = 115{\textbackslash}pm19{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. The rocky planet regime is shown to follow \$M {\textbackslash}propto R{\textasciicircum}\{0.34{\textbackslash}pm0.01\}\$, whilst neptunes have \$M{\textbackslash}propto R{\textasciicircum}\{0.55{\textbackslash}pm0.02\}\$. Planets in both regimes are seen to extend to similar maximum masses. In the jovian regime, we find that \$M {\textbackslash}propto R{\textasciicircum}\{0.00{\textbackslash}pm0.01\}T{\textasciicircum}\{0.35{\textbackslash}pm 0.02\}\$, where \$T\$ is the planet equilibrium temperature. This implies that, for jovian planets detected so far, equilibrium temperature alone provides a robust estimator of mass.},

  abstract = {Ariel has been selected as ESA's M4 mission for launch in 2028 and is designed for the characterization of a large and diverse population of exoplanetary atmospheres to provide insights into planetary formation and evolution within our Galaxy. Here we present a study of Ariel's capability to observe currently known exoplanets and predicted Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discoveries. We use the Ariel radiometric model (ArielRad) to simulate the instrument performance and find that {$\sim$}2000 of these planets have atmospheric signals which could be characterized by Ariel. This list of potential planets contains a diverse range of planetary and stellar parameters. From these we select an example mission reference sample (MRS), comprised of 1000 diverse planets to be completed within the primary mission life, which is consistent with previous studies. We also explore the mission capability to perform an in-depth survey into the atmospheres of smaller planets, which may be enriched or secondary. Earth-sized planets and super-Earths with atmospheres heavier than H/He will be more challenging to observe spectroscopically. However, by studying the time required to observe {$\sim$}110 Earth-sized/super-Earths, we find that Ariel could have substantial capability for providing in-depth observations of smaller planets. Trade-offs between the number and type of planets observed will form a key part of the selection process and this list of planets will continually evolve with new exoplanet discoveries replacing predicted detections. The Ariel target list will be constantly updated and the MRS re-selected to ensure maximum diversity in the population of planets studied during the primary mission life.},

  abstract = {The ESA Ariel mission has been adopted for launch in 2029 and will conduct a survey of around 1000 exoplanetary atmospheres during its primary mission life. By providing homogeneous data sets with a high signal-to-noise ratio and wide wavelength coverage, Ariel will unveil the atmospheric demographics of these faraway worlds, helping to constrain planet formation and evolution processes on a galactic scale. Ariel seeks to undertake a statistical survey of a diverse population of planets; therefore, the sample of planets from which this selection can be made is of the utmost importance. While many suitable targets have already been found, hundreds more will be discovered before the mission is operational. Previous studies have used predictions of exoplanet detections to forecast the available planet population by the launch date of Ariel, with the most recent noting that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) alone should provide over 1000 potential targets. In this work, we consider the planet candidates found to date by TESS to show that, with the addition of already confirmed planets, Ariel will already have a more than sufficient sample to choose its target list from once these candidates are validated. We showcase the breadth of this population, as well as exploring, for the first time, the ability of Ariel to characterize multiple planets within a single system. Comparative planetology of worlds orbiting the same star, as well as across the wider population, will undoubtedly revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and evolution.},

Another order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO.

  abstract = {We report discovery of a bright, nearby (\$G = 13.8;{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, d = 480{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm pc\$) Sun-like star orbiting a dark object. We identified the system as a black hole candidate via its astrometric orbital solution from the Gaia mission. Radial velocities validated and refined the Gaia solution, and spectroscopy ruled out significant light contributions from another star. Joint modeling of radial velocities and astrometry constrains the companion mass to M2 = 9.62 {\textpm} 0.18\,M{$\odot$}. The spectroscopic orbit alone sets a minimum companion mass of M2 \&gt; 5\,M{$\odot$}; if the companion were a 5\,M{$\odot$} star, it would be 500~times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints are insensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as a slowly-rotating G dwarf (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=5850{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$, log\,g = 4.5, M = 0.93\,M{$\odot$}), with near-solar metallicity (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] = -0.2\$) and an unremarkable abundance pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the orbit and does not involve a black hole. The orbital period, Porb = 185.6~days, is longer than that of any known stellar-mass black hole binary. The system's modest eccentricity (e = 0.45), high metallicity, and thin-disk Galactic orbit suggest that it was born in the Milky Way disk with at most a weak natal kick. How the system formed is uncertain. Common envelope evolution can only produce the system's wide orbit under extreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation models involving triples or dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more promising. This is the nearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery suggests the existence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries. Future Gaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.},

The orbital period, Porb~= 1277~d, is much longer than that of any previously studied BH binary. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 7-month period spans \&gt;90~per\,cent of the orbit's RV range and is in excellent agreement with the Gaia solution. UV imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule out plausible luminous companions that could explain the orbit. The star is a bright (G~= 12.3), slightly metal-poor (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]=-0.22\$) low-luminosity giant (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=4600{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$; \$R = 7.8{\textbackslash}, R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$; \${\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}left[g/{\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}right] = 2.6\$).

The giant is enhanced in {$\alpha$}-elements, with \${\textbackslash}rm [{\textbackslash}alpha /Fe] = +0.26\$, but the system's Galactocentric orbit is typical of the thin disc. We obtained X-ray and radio non-detections of the source near periastron, which support BH accretion models in which the net accretion rate at the horizon is much lower than the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton rate. At a distance of 1.16~kpc, Gaia BH2 is the second-nearest known BH, after Gaia BH1. Its orbit -- like that of Gaia BH1 -- seems too wide to have formed through common envelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at opposite edges of the Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal intrinsic period distribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2 significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins, but their formation pathways remain uncertain.},

  abstract = {Context.               The explosion of observational data on exoplanets gives many constraints on theoretical models of planet formation and evolution. Observational data probe very large areas of the parameter space and many different planet properties.                                         Aims.               Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to take a key step forward towards understanding planetary systems. It however requires a model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).                                         Methods.               We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and evolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their planetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full               N               -body calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the planets on gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides.                                         Results.               To test the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact phase of protoplanet-protoplanet collisions provided enough embryos ({\textasciitilde}100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Regarding the emergence of entire planetary systems, many aspects can be understood with the comparison of the timescales of growth and migration, the capture into resonances, and the consequences of large-scale dynamical instabilities caused by the gravitational interactions of protoplanets, including the situation when a second core starts runaway gas accretion.                                         Conclusions.               The Generation III Bern model provides one of the most comprehensive global end-to-end models of planetary system formation and evolution developed so far, linking a multitude of crucial physical processes self-consistently. The model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered (in period, mass, and radius), while giant-planet bearing systems show no such similarity. In a series of papers, the model will be used to perform extensive planetary population syntheses, putting the current theoretical understanding of planet formation and evolution to the observational test.},

  abstract = {Context.               Planetary formation and evolution is a combination of multiple interlinked processes. Constraining the mechanisms observationally requires statistical comparison to a large diversity of planetary systems.                                         Aims.               We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes (accretion, migration, and interactions) and initial properties (like disc masses and metallicities) on the demographics of the planetary population. We also want to study the convergence of our scheme with respect to one initial condition, the initial number of planetary embryo in each disc.                                         Methods.               We selected distributions of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs. Then, we used the Generation III Bern model to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population consisting of 1000 stars (systems) that was used for an extensive statistical analysis of planetary systems around 1               M               {$\odot$}               stars.                                         Results.               The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at least ten embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains, on average, eight planets more massive than 1               M               {$\oplus$}               . The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18\%, but only 1.6\% are at {$>$}10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. The planetary mass function varies as               M               -2               between 5 and 50               M               {$\oplus$}               . Both at lower and higher masses, it follows approximately               M               -1               . The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the 5--50               M               {$\oplus$}               range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. To assess the impact of parameters and model assumptions, we also study two non-nominal populations: insitu formation without gas-driven migration, and a different initial planetesimal surface density.                                         Conclusions.               We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provides a large data set to search for comparison synthetic planetary systems that show how these systems have come into existence. The systems, including their full formation and evolution tracks are available online. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is an important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Planetary population synthesis is a tool to understand the physics of planetary system formation. It builds on a model that includes a multitude of physical processes. The outcome can be statistically compared with exoplanet observations. Here, we review the population synthesis method and then use one population to explore how different planetary system architectures emerge and which conditions lead to their formation. The systems can be classified into four main architectures: Class I of near-in situ compositionally ordered terrestrial and ice planets, Class II of migrated sub-Neptunes, Class III of mixed low-mass and giant planets, broadly similar to the Solar System, and Class IV of dynamically active giants without inner low-mass planets. These four classes exhibit distinct typical formation pathways and are characterised by certain mass scales. Class I systems form from the local accretion of planetesimals followed by a giant impact phase, and the final planet masses correspond to the `Goldreich mass'. Class II systems form when planets reach the `equality mass' (equal accretion and migration timescales) before the dispersal of the gas disc, but not large enough to allow for rapid gas accretion. Giant planets form when the `equality mass' allows for rapid gas accretion while the planet are migrating, i.e. when the critical core mass is reached. The main discriminant of the four classes is the initial mass of solids in the disc, with contributions from the lifetime and mass of the gas disc. The breakdown into classes allows to better understand which physical processes are dominant. Comparison with observations reveals certain differences to the actual population, pointing at limitation of theoretical understanding. For example, the overrepresentation of synthetic super Earths and sub-Neptunes in Class I causes these planets to be found at lower metallicities than in observations.},

  abstract = {The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) enables nulling interferometric observations across the N band (8 to 13 {$\mu$}m) to suppress a star's bright light and probe for faint circumstellar emission. We present and statistically analyze the results from the LBTI/Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems survey for exozodiacal dust. By comparing our measurements to model predictions based on the solar zodiacal dust in the N band, we estimate a 1{$\sigma$} median sensitivity of 23 zodis times the solar system dust surface density in its habitable zone (HZ; 23 zodis) for early-type stars and 48 zodis for Sun-like stars, where 1 zodi is the surface density of HZ dust in the solar system. Of the 38 stars observed, 10 show significant excess. A clear correlation of our detections with the presence of cold dust in the systems was found, but none with the stellar spectral type or age. The majority of Sun-like stars have relatively low HZ dust levels (best-fit median: 3 zodis, 1{$\sigma$} upper limit: 9 zodis, 95\% confidence: 27 zodis based on our N band measurements), while {$\sim$}20\% are significantly more dusty. The solar system's HZ dust content is consistent with being typical. Our median HZ dust level would not be a major limitation to the direct imaging search for Earth-like exoplanets, but more precise constraints are still required, in particular to evaluate the impact of exozodiacal dust for the spectroscopic characterization of imaged exo-Earth candidates.},

We find that nearly all of these planets are strongly metal-enriched, which, coupled with the fact that solid material is the main deliverer of metals in the protoplanetary disk, implies that the substellar C/O ratios of their accreted solid material dominate compared to the enhanced C/O ratio of their accreted gaseous component. We predict that these planets will have atmospheres that are typically reduced in their C/O compared to parent star values independent of the assessed formation locations, with C/O {$<$} 1 a nearly universal outcome within the framework of the model. We expect water vapor absorption features to be ubiquitous in the atmospheres of these planets, and by extension, other gas giants.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique used over the past two decades to constrain the physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres1--5. One of its classical key assumptions is that the portion of the atmosphere it probes---the terminator region---is homogeneous. Several works from the past decade, however, have put this into question for highly irradiated, hot (Teq\,{$\greaterequivlnt$}\,1,000\,K) gas giant exoplanets, both empirically6--10 and through three-dimensional modelling11--17. While models have predicted clear differences between the evening (day-to-night) and morning (night-to-day) terminators, direct morning and evening transmission spectra in a wide wavelength range have not been reported for an exoplanet so far. Under the assumption of precise and accurate orbital parameters for the exoplanet WASP-39 b, here we report the detection of inhomogeneous terminators on WASP-39 b, which has allowed us to retrieve its morning and evening transmission spectra in the near-infrared (2--5\,{$\mu$}m) using the James Webb Space Telescope. We have observed larger transit depths in the evening, which are, on average, 405\,{\textpm}\,88\,ppm larger than the morning ones, and also have qualitatively larger features than the morning spectrum. The spectra are best explained by models in which the evening terminator is hotter than the morning terminator by \$\$17\{7\}\_\{-57\}{\textasciicircum}\{+65\}\$\$\,K, with both terminators having C/O ratios consistent with solar. General circulation models predict temperature differences broadly consistent with the above value and point towards a cloudy morning terminator and a clearer evening terminator.},

The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people's sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and leisure, self-selected and imposed, social and solo). Together the findings confirm that ``variety is the spice of life''---but not of an hour.},

(2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass--radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating {$\sim$}96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.{$^\circ$}0--2.{$^\circ$}2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

  abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system, consisting of an ultracool host star having seven known Earth-sized planets, will be a prime target for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, the detectability of atmospheric molecular species may be severely impacted by the presence of clouds and/or hazes. In this work, we perform 3D general circulation model (GCM) simulations with the LMD-G model supplemented by 1D photochemistry simulations at the terminator with the Atmos model to simulate several possible atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1e, 1f, and 1g: (1) modern Earth, (2) Archean Earth, and (3) CO2-rich atmospheres. The JWST synthetic transit spectra were computed using the GSFC Planetary Spectrum Generator. We find that the TRAPPIST-1e, 1f, and 1g atmospheres, with clouds and/or hazes, could be detected using JWST's NIRSpec Prism from the CO2 absorption line at 4.3 {$\mu$}m in less than 15 transits at 3{$\sigma$} or less than 35 transits at 5{$\sigma$}. However, our analysis suggests that other gases would require hundreds (or thousands) of transits to be detectable. We also find that H2O, mostly confined in the lower atmosphere, is very challenging to detect for these planets or similar systems if the planets' atmospheres are not in a moist greenhouse state. This result demonstrates that the use of GCMs, self-consistently taking into account the effect of clouds and subsaturation, is crucial to evaluate the detectability of atmospheric molecules of interest, as well as for interpreting future detections in a more global (and thus robust and relevant) approach.},

Here, we derive giant planets occurrence rates as a function of orbital period by taking into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV) surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the RV giant planet distribution between {$\sim$}2 and 3 au---close to the location of the snow line in the solar system---after which the occurrence rate decreases with distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger semimajor axes, we find good agreement with the {$\sim$}1\% planet occurrence rates from direct imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate that the occurrence of giant planets between 0.1 and 100 au is for planets with masses 0.1--20 MJ and decreases to for planets more massive than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures detected in disks around young stars can be attributed to giant planets. Various planet population synthesis models show good agreement with the observed distribution, and we show how a quantitative comparison between model and data can be used to constrain planet formation and migration mechanisms.},

These findings suggest that the primordial planet population is different from the Gyr-old Kepler population, and motivates exoplanet searches around young stars. Here, we present pterodactyls, a data reduction pipeline specifically built to address the challenges in discovering exoplanets around young stars and to work with TESS Primary Mission 30-minute cadence photometry, since most young stars were not preselected TESS two-minute cadence targets. pterodactyls builds on publicly available and tested tools in order to extract, detrend, search, and vet transiting young planet candidates. We search five clusters with known transiting planets: the Tucana--Horologium Association, IC 2602, Upper Centaurus Lupus, Ursa Major, and Pisces--Eridani. We show that pterodactyls recovers seven out of the eight confirmed planets and one out of the two planet candidates, most of which were initially detected in two-minute cadence data. For these clusters, we conduct injection-recovery tests to characterize our detection efficiency, and compute an intrinsic planet occurrence rate of 49\% {\textpm} 20\% for sub-Neptunes and Neptunes (1.8--6 R {$\oplus$}) within 12.5 days, which is higher than Kepler's Gyr-old occurrence rates of 6.8\% {\textpm} 0.3\%. This potentially implies that these planets have shrunk with time due to atmospheric mass loss. However, a proper assessment of the occurrence of transiting young planets will require a larger sample unbiased to planets already detected. As such, pterodactyls will be used in future work to search and vet for planet candidates in nearby clusters and moving groups.},

As such, it is important to accurately characterize the host stars since any systematic biases in their derivation can negatively impact the derivation of planetary properties. Here, we present a uniform catalog of photometrically-derived stellar effective temperatures, luminosities, radii, and masses for 4,865 young ({$<$}1 Gyr) stars in 31 nearby clusters and moving groups within 200 pc. We compared our photometrically-derived properties to a subset of those derived from spectra, and found them to be in good agreement. We also investigated the effect of stellar properties on the detection efficiency of transiting short-period young planets with TESS as calculated in Fernandes et al. 2022, and found an overall increase in the detection efficiency when the new photometrically derived properties were taken into account. Most notably, there is a 1.5 times increase in the detection efficiencies for sub-Neptunes/Neptunes (1.8-6 Re) implying that, for our sample of young stars, better characterization of host star properties can lead to the recovery of more small transiting planets. Our homogeneously derived catalog of updated stellar properties, along with a larger unbiased stellar sample and more detections of young planets, will be a crucial input to the accurate estimation of the occurrence rates of young short-period planets.},

We have explored the use of GALEX photometry as an activity indicator, using stars within 50 pc as a calibration sample representing the field and in selected nearby associations representing the youngest stages of stellar evolution. We present preliminary relations between UV flux and the optical activity indicator R{$\prime$}HK and between UV flux and age. We demonstrate that far-UV (FUV, 1350--1780 {\AA}) excess flux is roughly proportional to R{$\prime$}HK. We also detect a correlation between near-UV (NUV, 1780--2830 {\AA}) flux and activity or age, but the effect is much more subtle, particularly for stars older than {$\sim$}0.5--1 Gyr. Both the FUV and NUV relations show large scatter, {$\sim$}0.2 mag when predicting UV flux, {$\sim$}0.18 dex when predicting R{$\prime$}HK, and {$\sim$}0.4 dex when predicting age. This scatter appears to be evenly split between observational errors in current state-of-the-art data and long-term activity variability in the sample stars.},

  abstract = {Inferring properties of exoplanets from their atmospheres presents technical challenges in data collection due to low resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and theoretical challenges in the predictions made from forward-modeling due to errors introduced via incomplete or inaccurate assumptions in atmospheric physics and chemistry. The combination of these factors makes developing techniques to identify the most predictive features robust to low S/N and model error an increasingly important challenge for exoplanet science. Here we implement a multivariate approach to identify optimal predictors of the state of disequilibria. As a case study we focus on the prediction of vertical mixing (parameterized as eddy diffusion) in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We use multivariate information contained in molecular abundances, reaction network topology, and Gibbs free energy to demonstrate the variation in prediction efficacy of the vertical mixing coefficient (K zz) from different model information. While current approaches target inferring molecular abundances from spectral data, our results indicate that the set of optimal predictors of K zz varies with planetary properties such as irradiation temperature and metallicity. In most cases, multivariate data composed of network topological variables, which capture system-level features, perform as well as the set of optimal predictors and better than any individual variable. We discuss future directions, where identifying the set of optimal predictors should be useful for quantitatively ranking atmospheres in terms of their distance from thermochemical equilibrium, provide target variables for the development of new tools for inverse modeling, and provide applications to the longer-term goal of detection of disequilibria associated with life.},

Here, we characterize the reflectance spectra of a collection of purple sulfur and purple non-sulfur bacteria from a variety of anoxic and oxic environments.

  abstract = {The origin of life and the detection of alien life have historically been treated as separate scientific research problems. However, they are not strictly independent. Here, we discuss the need for a better integration of the sciences of life detection and origins of life. Framing these dual problems within the formalism of Bayesian hypothesis testing, we demonstrate via simple examples how high confidence in life detection claims require either (1) a strong prior hypothesis about the existence of life in a particular alien environment, or conversely, (2) signatures of life that are not susceptible to false positives. As a case study, we discuss the role of priors and hypothesis testing in recent results reporting potential detection of life in the venusian atmosphere and in the icy plumes of Enceladus. While many current leading biosignature candidates are subject to false positives because they are not definitive of life, our analyses demonstrate why it is necessary to shift focus to candidate signatures that are definitive. This indicates a necessity to develop methods that lack substantial false positives, by using observables for life that rely on prior hypotheses with strong theoretical and empirical support in identifying defining features of life. Abstract theories developed in pursuit of understanding universal features of life are more likely to be definitive and to apply to life-as-we-don't-know-it. We discuss Molecular Assembly theory as an example of such an observable which is applicable to life detection within the solar system. In the absence of alien examples these are best validated in origin of life experiments, substantiating the need for better integration between origins of life and biosignature science research communities. This leads to a conclusion that extraordinary claims in astrobiology (e.g., definitive detection of alien life) require extraordinary explanations, whereas the evidence itself could be quite ordinary.},

In particular, the typical use case would be to use one or more of these datasets to place constraints on the physical and orbital parameters of the system, such as planet mass or orbital period, while simultaneously taking into account the effects of stellar variability.},

However, it is not known whether these evolutionary old molecules have a prebiotic origin. We have serendipitously obtained pyrroles, which are the corresponding monomers, in laboratory experiments that simulated the interaction of amino acid--containing seawater with molten lava. The thermal pyrrole formation from amino acids, which so far has only been reported for special cases, can be explained by the observation that the amino acids become metal bonded, for example in (CaCl2)3(Hala)2{$\cdot$}6H2O (Hala=DL-alanine), when the seawater evaporates. At a few hundred degrees Celsius, sea salt crusts also release hydrochloric acid (HCl). On primordial volcanic islands, the volatile pyrroles and HCl must have condensed at cooler locations, for example, in rock pools. There, pyrrole oligomerization may have occurred. To study this possibility, we added formaldehyde and nitrite, two species for which plausible prebiotic sources are known, to 2,4-diethylpyrrole and HCl. We found that even at high dilution conjugated (oxidized) oligomers, including octaethylporphyrin and other cyclic and open-chain tetrapyrroles, were formed. All experiments were conducted under rigorously oxygen-free conditions. Our results suggest that primitive versions of present-day biological cofactors such as chlorophylls, bilins, and heme were spontaneously abiotically synthesized on primordial volcanic islands and thus may have been available to the first protocells.

  abstract = {We develop and apply a model to quantify the global efficiency of radial orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories and radial birth profiles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age {$\tau$} as . Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age--metallicity relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength . We fit this model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the observed age--metallicity distribution of low-{$\alpha$} red clump stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple model reproduces the observed data well, and we find a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky Way of = 3.6 {\textpm} 0.1 kpc when marginalizing over all other aspects of the model. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds the Sun's birth radius at {$\sim$}5.2 kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration is typical, this mechanism indeed plays an important role in setting the structural regularity of disk galaxies.},

We present the most precise planet size distribution to date based on Gaia parallaxes, Kepler photometry, and spectroscopic temperatures from the California-Kepler Survey. Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of {$\sim$}1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a planet's orbital distance and its host-star mass, both of which are related to a planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the ``sub-Neptune desert'' and the width and slope of the gap support the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.},

Giant planets are more prevalent at orbital distances of 1--10 au compared to orbits interior or exterior of this range. The increase in planet occurrence at {$\sim$}1 au by a factor of {$\sim$}4 is highly statistically significant. A fall-off in giant planet occurrence at larger orbital distances is favored over models with flat or increasing occurrence. We measure giant planets per 100 stars with semimajor axes of 2--8 au and giant planets per 100 stars in the range 8--32 au, a decrease in occurrence with increasing orbital separation that is significant at the {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level. We find that the occurrence rate of sub-Jovian planets (0.1--1 Jupiter masses) is also enhanced for 1--10 au orbits. This suggests that lower-mass planets may share the formation or migration mechanisms that drive the increased prevalence near the water--ice line for their Jovian counterparts. Our measurements of cold gas giant occurrence are consistent with the latest results from direct imaging surveys and gravitational lensing surveys despite different stellar samples. We corroborate previous findings that giant planet occurrence increases with stellar mass and metallicity.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present the early installment of the third \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} A summary of the contents of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 results.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (\emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} - \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$}) colour are also available. The passbands for \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3. Finally, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3.\emph{Conclusions. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 represents a significant advance over \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}Archive, which is available through the \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}home page.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The Gaia DR3 Catalogue contains for the first time about eight hundred thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them. This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1 among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues. Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.},

  abstract = {Age is a stellar parameter that is both fundamental and difficult to determine. Among middle-aged M dwarfs, the most prolific hosts of close-in and detectable exoplanets, gyrochronology is the most promising method to assign ages, but requires calibration by rotation-temperature sequences (gyrochrones) in clusters of known ages. We curated a catalog of 249 late K- and M-type (Teff=3200-4200K) exoplanet host stars with established rotation periods, and applied empirical, temperature-dependent rotation-age relations based on relevant published gyrochrones, including one derived from observations of the 4~Gyr-old open cluster M67. We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper limits for 8 others, excluding 14 which are too rapidly rotating or are otherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated uncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters, error in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar metallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not incorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar-metallicity. The age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10~Gyr, the age of the Galactic disk, with the handful of outliers explainable by large uncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to more thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space, more precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate stellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age estimates of these important exoplanet host stars.},

  abstract = {M dwarf stars are not only the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, they provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using Gaia astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties, filter binaries, and assign ages, we refined the radii of 179 transiting planets orbiting 119 single late K- and early M-type stars detected by the Kepler mission, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages ) to 115 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of {$<$}4R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ planets and assessed its evolution with time. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at {\textasciitilde}1.3R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at {\textasciitilde}2.2Rearth) separated by a gap or "valley" at \${\textbackslash}approx\$1.7R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.026\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.017\}\$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods (\${$<\$$}2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.8 Gyr), although the formal significance is low (\$p = 0.06\$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced at long orbital periods vs. short periods; this is not due to detection bias and could indicate that these objects are inflated by a mechanism that operates at elevated irradiance, e.g. a runaway water greenhouse augmented by H/He.},

The conditional occurrences we find here can be used to constrain the validity of various planetary formation models. The extremely interesting correlations between the super-Earths, cold Jupiters, and warm Jupiters can also be used to understand the formation histories of these planetary types.},

  abstract = {We put forward a model for accretion disks around T Tauri stars. The model assumes that angular momentum transport is driven by magnetic fields and can occur only in those parts of the disk that are sufficiently ionized that the gas can couple to the magnetic field. These regions lie at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU, where collisional ionization is effective, and at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU in a layer of thickness {$\asymp$} 100 g cm-2 at the surface of the disk where cosmic-ray ionization is effective. The model predicts that the stellar accretion rate is about 10-8 Msun yr-1, independent of the rate of infall onto the disk. Matter that is not accreted onto the star accumulates in the inner few AU of the disk at a rate of about 10-3 Msun in 104 yr. Given this buildup it is unlikely that accretion is steady. The effective temperature profile is Te {$\sim$} r-1/2 outside of 0.1 AU, which differs from the canonical Te {$\sim$} r-3/4. We calculate the expected spectral energy distribution for the disk and show that this temperature profile produces an infrared excess. Finally, we discuss some of the leading uncertainties in the theory.},

While Proxima b is in a ``temperate orbit,'' i.e., an Earth at that location would not freeze or boil its oceans, its proximity to a parent star with quite high magnetic activity is likely to influence its atmospheric evolution and habitability. Planetary magnetic fields can prevent direct stripping away of the planetary atmosphere by the stellar wind, but ion escape can still occur at the magnetic poles. This process, the polar wind, is well known to occur at Earth and may have contributed to the habitability of Earth's early atmosphere. The polar wind is highly variable and sensitive to both ionizing radiation and geomagnetic activity. The higher ionizing radiation levels of M dwarfs at habitable zone distances are expected to increase the polar wind by orders of magnitude and, instead of helping create a habitable atmosphere, may strip away enough volatiles to render the planet inhospitable. Here, we compute the ionospheric outflow of an Earth-twin subject to the enhanced stellar EUV flux of Proxima b, and the effect on atmospheric escape timescales. We show that an Earth-like planet would not survive the escape of its atmosphere at that location, and therefore the pathway to habitability for Proxima b requires a very different atmospheric history than that of Earth.},

The addition of more Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) systems in 2022 filled this region of the diagram of stellar rotation period (Prot) versus the planet orbital period (Porb). We revisited the Prot extraction of Kepler planet-host stars, we classify the stars by their spectral type, and we studied their Prot-Porb relations. We only used confirmed exoplanet systems to minimize biases. In order to learn about the physical processes at work, we used the star-planet evolution code ESPEM (French acronym for Evolution of Planetary Systems and Magnetism) to compute a realistic population synthesis of exoplanet systems and compared them with observations. Because ESPEM works with a single planet orbiting around a single main-sequence star, we limit our study to this population of Kepler observed systems filtering out binaries, evolved stars, and multi-planets. We find in both, observations and simulations, the existence of a dearth in close-in planets orbiting around fast-rotating stars, with a dependence on the stellar spectral type (F, G, and K), which is a proxy of the mass in our sample of stars. There is a change in the edge of the dearth as a function of the spectral type (and mass). It moves towards shorter Prot as temperature (and mass) increases, making the dearth look smaller. Realistic formation hypotheses included in the model and the proper treatment of tidal and magnetic migration are enough to qualitatively explain the dearth of hot planets around fast-rotating stars and the uncovered trend with spectral type.},

  abstract = {We propose to develop a wide-field and ultra-high-precision photometric survey mission, temporarily named "Earth 2.0 (ET)". This mission is designed to measure, for the first time, the occurrence rate and the orbital distributions of Earth-sized planets. ET consists of seven 30cm telescopes, to be launched to the Earth-Sun's L2 point. Six of these are transit telescopes with a field of view of 500 square degrees. Staring in the direction that encompasses the original Kepler field for four continuous years, this monitoring will return tens of thousands of transiting planets, including the elusive Earth twins orbiting solar-type stars. The seventh telescope is a 30cm microlensing telescope that will monitor an area of 4 square degrees toward the galactic bulge. This, combined with simultaneous ground-based KMTNet observations, will measure masses for hundreds of long-period and free-floating planets. Together, the transit and the microlensing telescopes will revolutionize our understandings of terrestrial planets across a large swath of orbital distances and free space. In addition, the survey data will also facilitate studies in the fields of asteroseismology, Galactic archeology, time-domain sciences, and black holes in binaries.},

  abstract = {It is generally believed that very fast cameras imaging large Fields of View translate into huge optomechanics and mosaics of very large contiguous CCDs. It has already been suggested that seeing limited imaging cameras for telescopes whose diameters are larger than 20m are considered virtually impossible for a reasonable cost. It has also been suggested that using existing technology and at a moderate price, one can build a Smart Fast Camera, a device that placed on aberrated Field of View, including those of slow focal ratios, is able to provide imaging at an equivalent focal ratio as low as F/1, with a size that is identical to the large focal ratio focal plane size. The design allows for easy correction of aberrations over the Field of View. It has low weight and size with respect to any focal reducer or prime focus station of the same performance. It can be applied to existing 8m-class telescopes to provide a wide field fast focal plane or to achieve seeing-limited imaging on Extremely Large Telescopes. As it offers inherently fast read-out in a massive parallel mode, the SFC can be used as a pupil or focal plane camera for pupil-plane or Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing for 30-100m class telescopes. Basing upon Smart Fast Camera concept, we present a study turned to explain the pliability of this instrument for different existing telescopes.},

  abstract = {We present independent and self-consistent metallicities for a sample of 807 planet-hosting stars from the California-Kepler Survey from an LTE spectroscopic analysis using a selected sample of Fe i and Fe ii lines. Correlations between host-star metallicities, planet radii, and planetary architecture (orbital periods---warm or hot---and multiplicity---single or multiple) were investigated using nonparametric statistical tests. In addition to confirming previous results from the literature, e.g., that overall host-star metallicity distributions differ between hot and warm planetary systems of all types, we report on a new finding: when comparing the median metallicities of hot versus warm systems, the difference for multiple super-Earths is considerably larger when compared to that difference in single super-Earths. The metallicity cumulative distribution functions of hot single super-Earths versus warm single super-Earths indicate different parent stellar populations, while for sub-Neptunes this is not the case. The transition radius between sub-Neptunes and sub-Saturns was examined by comparing the APOGEE metallicity distribution for the Milky Way thin disk in the solar neighborhood with metallicity distributions of host stars segregated based upon the largest known planet in their system. These comparisons reveal increasingly different metallicity distributions as the radius of the largest planet in the systems increases, with the parent stellar metallicities becoming significantly different for R p {$>$} 2.7 R {$\oplus$}. The behavior of the p-values as a function of planet radius undergoes a large slope change at R p = 4.4 {\textpm} 0.5 R {$\oplus$}, indicating the radius boundary between small and large planets.},

We identify 18 potentially terrestrial planet candidates detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that would make ideal targets for these observations. These planet candidates cover a broad range of planet radii (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.6 - 2.0 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) and orbit stars of various magnitudes (\$K\_s = 5.78 - 10.78\$, \$V = 8.4 - 15.69\$) and effective temperatures (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff \}{\textbackslash}sim 3000 - 6000\$ K). We use ground-based observations collected through the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) and two vetting tools -- DAVE and TRICERATOPS -- to assess the reliabilities of these candidates as planets. We validate 13 planets: TOI-206 b, TOI-500 b, TOI-544 b, TOI-833 b, TOI-1075 b, TOI-1411 b, TOI-1442 b, TOI-1693 b, TOI-1860 b, TOI-2260 b, TOI-2411 b, TOI-2427 b, and TOI-2445 b.

A systematic search and selection were carried out on a surface of {$\sim$}16 000 deg{\textasciicircum}2 on almost the whole area of the FBS. Since 2007, all FBS low-resolution spectral plates have been digitized. The second version of the "Revised and Updated Catalogue of the First Byurakan Survey of Late-Type Stars", containing data for 1471 M and C (carbon) stars (130 C-type giants, 1105 M - giants, and 236 M dwarfs) was generated. Among the 236 M dwarfs selected, 176 are new discoveries. The Gaia EDR3 G broad-band magnitudes are in the range 11.3 {$<$} G {$<$} 17.1. New distance information by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), which is based on the EDR3 parallaxes are used to estimate the G-band absolute magnitudes for M dwarfs. 9 FBS M dwarfs (out of 176 new discovered) lie within 25 pc of the Sun. The object FBS 0909-082 is more distant (r = 780{\. }pc) M dwarf among the sample considered, for which G-band absolute magnitude M(G) = 9.18, M = 0.59 MSun, L = 0.13597 L\_sun, and T\_eff = 3844 K. This object can be classified as M1-M2 sub-type dwarf. The nearest object is FBS 0250+167, a M7 subtype dwarf with very high proper motion (5.13 arcsec/yr) and is located at 3.83 pc from the Sun. The TESS estimated masses lie in the range 095 ({\textpm}0.02) M\_sun {$\leq$} M {$\leq$} 0.7 ({\textpm} 0.1) M\_sun and T\_eff in the range 4000K {$<$} T\_eff {$<$} 2790K for FBS M dwarfs.

  abstract = {Discovering transiting exoplanets with relatively long orbital periods (\&gt;10\,d) is crucial to facilitate the study of cool exoplanet atmospheres (Teq \&lt; 700\,K) and to understand exoplanet formation and inward migration further out than typical transiting exoplanets. In order to discover these longer period transiting exoplanets, long-term photometric, and radial velocity campaigns are required. We report the discovery of TOI-2447\,b (=NGTS-29\,b), a Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright (T~=~10.0) Solar-type star (Teff~=~5730\,K). TOI-2447\,b was identified as a transiting exoplanet candidate from a single transit event of 1.3 per\,cent depth and 7.29\,h duration in TESS Sector 31 and a prior transit event from 2017 in NGTS data. Four further transit events were observed with NGTS photometry which revealed an orbital period of P~=~69.34\,d. The transit events establish a radius for TOI-2447\,b of \$0.865 {\textbackslash}pm 0.010{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$, while radial velocity measurements give a mass of \$0.386 {\textbackslash}pm 0.025{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$. The equilibrium temperature of the planet is 414\,K, making it much cooler than the majority of TESS planet discoveries. We also detect a transit signal in NGTS data not caused by TOI-2447\,b, along with transit timing variations and evidence for a {$\sim$}150\,d signal in radial velocity measurements. It is likely that the system hosts additional planets, but further photometry and radial velocity campaigns will be needed to determine their parameters with confidence. TOI-2447\,b/NGTS-29\,b joins a small but growing population of cool giants that will provide crucial insights into giant planet composition and formation mechanisms.},

From the observation of Mars to present-day efforts toward Venus and the characterization of exoplanets, the search for life, or at least environments that could accommodate life, has been a major drive for space exploration. So far, we have found no other unquestionably habitable world besides Earth. The conditions of the habitability of terrestrial planets have proved elusive, as surface conditions depend on the complex interplay of many processes throughout the evolution of a planet. Here, we review how the interior of a rocky planet can drive the evolution of its surface conditions and atmosphere. Instead of listing criteria assumed to be critical for life, we discuss how the bulk-silicate planet can affect the onset, continuation, and cessation of habitability. We then consider how it can be observed, and current efforts toward this end.},

  abstract = {Located at the bottom of the main sequence, ultracool dwarf stars are widespread in the solar neighbourhood. Nevertheless, their extremely low luminosity has left their planetary population largely unexplored, and only one of them, TRAPPIST-1, has so far been found to host a transiting planetary system. In this context, we present the SPECULOOS project's detection of an Earth-sized planet in a 17\,h orbit around an ultracool dwarf of M6.5 spectral type located 16.8\,pc away. The planet's high irradiation (16 times that of Earth) combined with the infrared luminosity and Jupiter-like size of its host star make it one of the most promising rocky exoplanet targets for detailed emission spectroscopy characterization with JWST. Indeed, our sensitivity study shows that just ten secondary eclipse observations with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument/Low-Resolution Spectrometer on board JWST should provide strong constraints on its atmospheric composition and/or surface mineralogy.},

  abstract = {Located at the bottom of the main sequence, ultracool dwarf stars are widespread in the solar neighbourhood. Nevertheless, their extremely low luminosity has left their planetary population largely unexplored, and only one of them, TRAPPIST-1, has so far been found to host a transiting planetary system. In this context, we present the SPECULOOS project's detection of an Earth-sized planet in a 17 h orbit around an ultracool dwarf of M6.5 spectral type located 16.8 pc away. The planet's high irradiation (16 times that of Earth) combined with the infrared luminosity and Jupiter-like size of its host star make it one of the most promising rocky exoplanet targets for detailed emission spectroscopy characterization with JWST. Indeed, our sensitivity study shows that just ten secondary eclipse observations with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument/Low-Resolution Spectrometer on board JWST should provide strong constraints on its atmospheric composition and/or surface mineralogy.},

  abstract = {Some recently discovered short-period Earth to Neptune sized exoplanets (super Earths) have low observed mean densities which can only be explained by voluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the conditions allowing the accretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass) following the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the underlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles than the core (equivalently, lighter than a few \% of the planet's mass) can be blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the mass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres, while not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion and become gas giants (Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed super-Earth population and find that low-density planets are indeed concentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive model can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.},

  abstract = {Stellar mass is a fundamental parameter that is key to our understanding of stellar formation and evolution, as well as the characterization of nearby exoplanet companions. Historically, stellar masses have been derived from long-term observations of visual or spectroscopic binary star systems. While advances in high-resolution imaging have enabled observations of systems with shorter orbital periods, stellar mass measurements remain challenging, and relatively few have been precisely measured. We present a new statistical approach to measuring masses for populations of stars. Using Gaia astrometry, we analyze the relative orbital motion of \${$>$}3,800\$ wide binary systems comprising low-mass stars to establish a Mass-Magnitude relation in the Gaia \$G\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{RP\}\$ band spanning the absolute magnitude range \$14.5{$>$}M\_\{G\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{RP\}\}{$>$}4.0\$, corresponding to a mass range of \$0.08\${\textasciitilde}M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M{\textbackslash}lesssim1.0\${\textasciitilde}M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. This relation is directly applicable to \${$>$}30\$ million stars in the Gaia catalog. Based on comparison to existing Mass-Magnitude relations calibrated for 2MASS \$K\_\{s\}\$ magnitudes, we estimate that the internal precision of our mass estimates is \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textbackslash}\%\$. We use this relation to estimate masses for a volume-limited sample of \${\textbackslash}sim\$18,200 stars within 50{\textasciitilde}pc of the Sun and the present-day field mass function for stars with \$M{\textbackslash}lesssim 1.0\${\textasciitilde}M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which we find peaks at 0.16{\textasciitilde}M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We investigate a volume-limited sample of wide binary systems with early K dwarf primaries, complete for binary mass ratios \$q{$>$}0.2\$, and measure the distribution of \$q\$ at separations \${$>$}100\${\textasciitilde}au. We find that our distribution of \$q\$ is not uniformly distributed, rather decreasing towards \$q=1.0\$.},

  abstract = {The search for life on exoplanets is one of the grand scientific challenges of our time. The strategy to date has been to find (e.g., through transit surveys like Kepler) earthlike exoplanets in their stars' habitable zone, then use transmission spectroscopy to measure biosignature gases, especially oxygen, in the planets' atmospheres (e.g., using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)). Already there are more such planets than can be observed by JWST, and missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and others will find more. A better understanding of the geochemical cycles relevant to biosignature gases is needed, to prioritize targets for costly follow-up observations and to help design future missions. We define a Detectability Index to quantify the likelihood that a biosignature gas could be assigned a biological versus nonbiological origin. We apply this index to the case of oxygen gas, O2, on earthlike planets with varying water contents. We demonstrate that on earthlike exoplanets with 0.2 weight percent (wt\%) water (i.e., no exposed continents) a reduced flux of bioessential phosphorus limits the export of photosynthetically produced atmospheric O2 to levels indistinguishable from geophysical production by photolysis of water plus hydrogen escape. Higher water contents {$>$}1 wt\% that lead to high-pressure ice mantles further slow phosphorus cycling. Paradoxically, the maximum water content allowing use of O2 as a biosignature, 0.2 wt\%, is consistent with no water based on mass and radius. Thus, the utility of an O2 biosignature likely requires the direct detection of both water and land on a planet.},

The mission is designed to search for global atmospheric biosignatures on dozens of temperate terrestrial exoplanets and it will naturally investigate the diversity of other worlds. Here, we review the status of the mission concept, discuss the key mission parameters, and outline the trade-offs related to the mission's architecture. In preparation for an upcoming concept study, we define a mission baseline based on a free-formation flying constellation of a double Bracewell nulling interferometer that consists of 4 collectors and a central beam-combiner spacecraft. The interferometric baselines are between 10--600m, and the estimated diameters of the collectors are at least 2m (but will depend on the total achievable instrument throughput). The spectral required wavelength range is 6--16\&mu;m (with a goal of 4--18.5\&mu;m), hence cryogenic temperatures are needed both for the collectors and the beam combiners. One of the key challenges is the required deep, stable, and broad-band nulling performance while maintaining a high system throughput for the planet signal. Among many ongoing or needed technology development activities, the demonstration of the measurement principle under cryogenic conditions is fundamentally important for LIFE.},

  abstract = {The nearby ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 possesses several Earth-sized terrestrial planets, three of which have equilibrium temperatures that may support liquid surface water, making it a compelling target for exoplanet characterization. TRAPPIST-1 is an active star with frequent flaring, with implications for the habitability of its planets. Superflares (stellar flares whose energy exceeds 1033 erg) can completely destroy the atmospheres of a cool star's planets, allowing ultraviolet radiation and high-energy particles to bombard their surfaces. However, ultracool dwarfs emit little ultraviolet flux when quiescent, raising the possibility of frequent flares being necessary for prebiotic chemistry that requires ultraviolet light. We combine Evryscope and Kepler observations to characterize the high-energy flare rate of TRAPPIST-1. The Evryscope is an array of 22 small telescopes imaging the entire Southern sky in g{$\prime$} every two minutes. Evryscope observations, spanning 170 nights over 2 yr, complement the 80 day continuous short-cadence K2 observations by sampling TRAPPIST-1's long-term flare activity. We update TRAPPIST-1's superflare rate, finding a cumulative rate of superflares per year. We calculate the flare rate necessary to deplete ozone in the habitable-zone planets' atmospheres, and find that TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is insufficient to deplete ozone if present on its planets. In addition, we calculate the flare rate needed to provide enough ultraviolet flux to power prebiotic chemistry. We find TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is likely insufficient to catalyze some of the Earthlike chemical pathways thought to lead to ribonucleic acid synthesis, and flux due to flares in the biologically relevant UV-B band is orders of magnitude less for any TRAPPIST-1 planet than has been experienced by Earth at any time in its history.},

Here, we evaluate the usefulness of carbon dioxide isotopologues as evidence of aerial life. Carbon isotopes are of particular interest as metabolic processes preferentially use the lighter \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C over \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C. In principle, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to spectrally resolve the \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C isotopologues of CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but not CO and CH\$\_\{4\}\$. We simulated observations of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues in the H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmospheres of our nearest (\${$<$} 40\$ pc), temperate (equilibrium temperature of 250-350 K) sub-Neptunes with M dwarf host stars. We find \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ distinguishable if the atmosphere is H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ for the most idealized target with an Earth-like composition of the two most abundant isotopologues, \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$. With a Neptune-like metallicity of 100\${\textbackslash}times\$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable to distinguish between \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in a H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues with JWST. In contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but the smaller atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era. Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {The ultimate climate emergency is a `runaway greenhouse': a hot and water-vapour-rich atmosphere limits the emission of thermal radiation to space, causing runaway warming. Warming ceases only after the surface reaches approximately 1400\,K and emits radiation in the near-infrared, where water is not a good greenhouse gas. This would evaporate the entire ocean and exterminate all planetary life. Venus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past, and we expect that the Earth will in around 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases. But could we bring on such a catastrophe prematurely, by our current climate-altering activities? Here, we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer this question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how climate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of evidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle, to trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of non-condensible greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, our understanding of the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and steamy atmospheres is weak. We cannot therefore completely rule out the possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one. High climate sensitivity might provide a warning. If we, or more likely our remote descendants, are threatened with a runaway greenhouse, then geoengineering to reflect sunlight might be life's only hope. Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere would be too short-lived, and even sunshades in space might require excessive maintenance. In the distant future, modifying Earth's orbit might provide a sustainable solution. The runaway greenhouse also remains relevant in planetary sciences and astrobiology: as extrasolar planets smaller and nearer to their stars are detected, some will be in a runaway greenhouse state.},

  abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate---the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using a modern spectral database. We find a thermal radiation limit of 282\,W\,m-2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294\,W\,m-2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported). Therefore, a steam atmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated with water, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

  abstract = {There are four different stable climate states for pure water atmospheres, as might exist on so-called ``waterworlds.'' I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars-sized to 10 Earth-mass. The states are as follows: globally ice covered (Ts⪅245\,K), cold and damp (270⪅Ts⪅290\,K), hot and moist (350⪅Ts⪅550\,K), and very hot and dry (Tsx2A86;900\,K). No stable climate exists for 290⪅Ts ⪅350\,K or 550⪅Ts⪅900\,K. The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describes the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong nonlinearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight. Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker gravity; the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35\,W m-2 higher for Mars, 10\,W m-2 higher for Earth or Venus, but only a few W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion-neglected) trend of increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40\,W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that Venus-sized (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway greenhouse. The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone requires background gas and greenhouse gas: N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.

  abstract = {Reflection spectroscopy holds great promise for characterizing the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets. The surface of the modern Earth exhibits a sharp albedo change near 750 nm caused by vegetation - the red edge - which would leave a strong spectral signature if present on an exoplanet. However, the retrieval of wavelength-dependent surface properties from reflection spectra has seen relatively little study. Here, we propose a new surface albedo parameterization capable of retrieving the wavelength location of a priori unknown 'edge-like' features. We demonstrate that a wavelength-dependent surface albedo model achieves higher accuracy in retrieving atmospheric composition. Wavelength-dependent surfaces are also generally preferred over a uniform albedo model when retrieving simulated reflection spectra for a modern Earth analog, even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 10) and Earth-like clouds. Further, the location of the modern Earth's red edge can be robustly and precisely constrained (within 70 nm for S/N = 10). Our results suggest that future space-based direct imaging missions have the potential to infer surface compositions for rocky exoplanets, including spectral edges similar to those caused by life on the modern Earth.},

  abstract = {We propose the concept of a ``Galactic Habitable Zone'' (GHZ). Analogous to the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ), the GHZ is that region in the Milky Way where an Earth-like planet can retain liquid water on its surface and provide a long-term habitat for animal-like aerobic life. In this paper we examine the dependence of the GHZ on Galactic chemical evolution. The single most important factor is likely the dependence of terrestrial planet mass on the metallicity of its birth cloud. We estimate, very approximately, that a metallicity at least half that of the Sun is required to build a habitable terrestrial planet. The mass of a terrestrial planet has important consequences for interior heat loss, volatile inventory, and loss of atmosphere. A key issue is the production of planets that sustain plate tectonics, a critical recycling process that provides feedback to stabilize atmospheric temperatures on planets with oceans and atmospheres. Due to the more recent decline from the early intense star formation activity in the Milky Way, the concentration in the interstellar medium of the geophysically important radioisotopes 40K, 235,238U, and 232Th has been declining relative to Fe, an abundant element in the Earth. Also likely important are the relative abundances of Si and Mg to Fe, which affects the mass of the core relative to the mantle in a terrestrial planet. All these elements and isotopes vary with time and location in the Milky Way; thus, planetary systems forming in other locations and times in the Milky Way with the same metallicity as the Sun will not necessarily form habitable Earth-like planets. As a result of the radial Galactic metallicity gradient, the outer limit of the GHZ is set primarily by the minimum required metallicity to build large terrestrial planets. Regions of the Milky Way least likely to contain Earth-mass planets are the halo (including globular clusters), the thick disk, and the outer thin disk. The bulge should contain Earth-mass planets, but stars in it have a mix of elements different from the Sun's. The existence of a luminosity--metallicity correlation among galaxies of all types means that many galaxies are too metal-poor to contain Earth-mass planets. Based on the observed luminosity function of nearby galaxies in the visual passband, we estimate that (1) the Milky Way is among the 1.3\% most luminous (and hence most metal-rich) galaxies and (2) about 23\% of stars in a typical ensemble of galaxies are more metal-rich than the average star in the Milky Way. The GHZ zone concept can be easily extrapolated to the universe as a whole, especially with regard to the changing star formation rate and its effect on metallicity and abundances of the long-lived radioisotopes.},

Flight emissions have a major share of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of research institutions but reducing them is challenging, because flying has become an essential part of academic culture. While there is a large amount of literature on the relevance of flight reduction in academia, very little data and hands-on experience exists on what a successful reduction process might entail. This paper contributes to closing this gap by presenting data from interviews and surveys from eight academic institutions on reasons for air travel and alternatives, showing how a transdisciplinary approach can support a transformation from a high to a low flying culture, and suggesting a practical path forward with the aid of an open-access toolbox on how to reduce flight emissions in academia.},

We also added archival ESO/HARPS data for GJ 724 and infrared RV measurements from Subaru/IRD for GJ 3988. We searched for periodic and stable signals to subsequently construct Keplerian models, considering different numbers of planets, and we selected the best models based on their Bayesian evidence.

Until now, it was not even realized that the 2 paths are in conflict: Roman strategy was optimized for bound-planet detections, and FFPs were considered only in the context of what could be learned about them given this strategy. We derive a simple equation that mathematically expresses this conflict and explains why the current approach severely depresses detection of 2 of the 5 decades of potential FFP masses, i.e., exactly the two decades, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Pluto\}{$<$} M {$<$}2{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Mars\}\$, that would tie terrestrial planets to the proto-planetary material out of which they formed. FFPs can be either truly free floating or can be bound in "Wide", "Kuiper", and "Oort" orbits, whose separate identification will allow further insight into planet formation. In the (low-mass) limit that the source radius is much bigger than the Einstein radius, \${\textbackslash}theta\_*{\textbackslash}gg{\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}\$, the number of significantly magnified points on the FFP light curve is \$N=2{\textbackslash}Gamma{\textbackslash}theta\_*{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1-z{\textasciicircum}2\}/{\textbackslash}mu\$ --{$>$} 3.0, when normalized to the adopted Roman cadence \${\textbackslash}Gamma=4/\$hr, and to source radius \${\textbackslash}theta\_*=0.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$as, lens-source proper motion \${\textbackslash}mu=6{\textbackslash},\$mas/yr, and source impact parameter \$z=0.5\$, which are all typical values. By contrast \$N=6\$ are needed for an FFP detection. Thus, unless \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ is doubled, FFP detection will be driven into the (large-\${\textbackslash}theta\_*\$, small-\${\textbackslash}mu\$) corner of parameter space, reducing the detections by a net factor of 2 and cutting off the lowest-mass FFPs.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that planets belonging to the same close-in, compact multiple-planet system tend to exhibit a striking degree of uniformity in their sizes. A similar trend has also been found to hold for the masses of such planets, but considerations of such intra-system mass uniformity have generally been limited to statistical samples wherein a majority of systems have constituent planetary mass measurements obtained via analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs). Since systems with strong TTV signals typically lie in or near mean motion resonance, it remains to be seen whether intra-system mass uniformity is still readily emergent for nonresonant systems with non-TTV mass provenance. We thus present in this work a mass uniformity analysis of 17 non-TTV systems with masses measured via radial velocity measurements. Using the Gini index, a common statistic for economic inequality, as our primary metric for uniformity, we find that our sample of 17 non-TTV systems displays intra-system mass uniformity at a level of {$\sim$}2.5{$\sigma$} confidence. We provide additional discussion of possible statistical and astrophysical underpinnings for this result. We also demonstrate the existence of a correlation (r = 0.25) between characteristic solid surface density ({$\Sigma$}0) of the minimum-mass extrasolar nebula and system mass Gini index, suggesting that more-massive disks may generally form systems with more-unequal planetary masses.},

However, variations in global carbon budget and unstable feedback cycles between planetary sub-systems may destabilize the climate of rocky exoplanets toward regimes unknown in the Solar System. Here, we perform clear-sky atmospheric radiative transfer and surface weathering simulations to probe the stability of climate equilibria for rocky, ocean-bearing exoplanets at instellations relevant for planetary systems in the outer regions of the circumstellar habitable zone. Our simulations suggest that planets orbiting G- and F-type stars (but not M-type stars) may display bistability between an Earth-like climate state with efficient carbon sequestration and an alternative stable climate equilibrium where CO\$\_2\$ condenses at the surface and forms a blanket of either clathrate hydrate or liquid CO\$\_2\$. At increasing instellation and with ineffective weathering, the latter state oscillates between cool, surface CO\$\_2\$-condensing and hot, non-condensing climates. CO\$\_2\$ bistable climates may emerge early in planetary history and remain stable for billions of years. The carbon dioxide-condensing climates follow an opposite trend in \$p\$CO\$\_2\$ versus instellation compared to the weathering-stabilized planet population, suggesting the possibility of observational discrimination between these distinct climate categories.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet transmission spectra, which measure the absorption of light passing through a planet's atmosphere during transit, are most often assessed globally, resulting in a single spectrum per planetary atmosphere. However, the inherent 3D nature of planetary atmospheres, via thermal, chemical, and dynamical processes, can imprint inhomogeneous structure and properties in the observables. In this work, we devise a technique for spatially mapping the atmospheres of exoplanets in transmission. Our approach relaxes the assumption that transit light curves are created from circular stars occulted by circular planets, and instead we allow for flexibility in the planet's sky-projected shape. We define the planet's radius to be a single-valued function of angle around its limb, and we refer to this mathematical object as a transmission string. These transmission strings are parametrized in terms of Fourier series, a choice motivated by these series having adjustable complexity, generating physically practical shapes, while being reducible to the classical circular case. The utility of our technique is primarily intended for high-precision multiwavelength light curves, from which inferences of transmission spectra can be made as a function of angle around a planet's terminator, enabling analysis of the multidimensional physics at play in exoplanet atmospheres. More generally, the technique can be applied to any transit light curve to derive the shape of the transiting body. The algorithm we develop is available as an open-source package, called harmonica1.},

  abstract = {Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO\$\_2\$(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO\$\_2\$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO\$\_2\$(s) clouds are comprised of small \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.01\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H\$\_2\$O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species.

These measurements are most consistent with re-radiation of the incident flux of the TRAPPIST-1 star from only the dayside hemisphere of the planet. The most straightforward interpretation is that there is little or no planetary atmosphere redistributing radiation from the host star and also no detectable atmospheric absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other species.},

Using the Solar System as our guide we first summarize the main processes which sculpt atmospheric evolution then discuss their potential interactions in the context of exoplanetary environments. We summarize key uncertainties and consider a diverse range of atmospheric compositions discussing their potential occurrence in an exoplanetary context.},

The GREX-PLUS spacecraft will carry a 1.2 m primary mirror aperture telescope cooled down to 50 K. The two science instruments will be onboard: a wide-field camera in the 2-8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m wavelength band and a high resolution spectrometer with a wavelength resolution of 30,000 in the 10-18 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m band. The GREX-PLUS wide-field camera aims to detect the first generation of galaxies at redshift \$z{$>$}15\$. The GREX-PLUS high resolution spectrometer aims to identify the location of the water ``snow line'' in proto-planetary disks. Both instruments will provide unique data sets for a broad range of scientific topics including galaxy mass assembly, origin of supermassive blackholes, infrared background radiation, molecular spectroscopy in the interstellar medium, transit spectroscopy for exoplanet atmosphere, planetary atmosphere in the Solar system, and so on.},

Each telescope is of a modified Dall-Kirkham design, using an 0.6m primary mirror and a 110 Mpix STA1600 CCD to give a 2.7 square degrees field-of-view sampled at 0.56"/pixel. Preliminary commissioning data shows performance on-par with design specifications. Data obtained with the BlackGEM prototype MeerLICHT highlights the capabilities of the design with a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of m\textsubscript{AB}=22.2 in 300s of integration under dark-sky conditions. Extrapolation to the 1" seeing-conditions expected at La Silla shows that the main goal of BlackGEM to probe down to m\textsubscript{AB}=23 in 300s can be met. The project suffered a 2-year COVID-19 delay. Commissioning of the array has currently been resumed and science operations are expected to start in Q3/Q4 of 2022. The science programs include the follow-up of gravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, a six-filter Southern Sky Survey, a Fast Synoptic Survey on selected fields, a Local Universe intra-night monitoring program and a inter-night single-band monitoring for slower transients.},

  abstract = {With the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets and a potentially huge number of Earth-like planets waiting to be discovered, the conditions for their habitability have become a focal point in exoplanetary research. The classical picture of habitable zones primarily relies on the stellar flux allowing liquid water to exist on the surface of an Earth-like planet with a suitable atmosphere. However, numerous further stellar and planetary properties constrain habitability. Apart from "geophysical" processes depending on the internal structure and composition of a planet, a complex array of astrophysical factors additionally determine habitability. Among these, variable stellar ultraviolet (UV), extreme ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray radiation; stellar and interplanetary magnetic fields; ionized winds; and energetic particles control the constitution of upper planetary atmospheres and their physical and chemical evolution. Short- and long-term stellar variability necessitates full time-dependent studies to understand planetary habitability at any point in time. Furthermore, dynamical effects in planetary systems and transport of water to Earth-like planets set fundamentally important constraints. We will review these astrophysical conditions for habitability under the crucial aspects of the long-term evolution of stellar properties, the consequent extreme conditions in the early evolutionary phase of planetary systems, and the important interplay between properties of the host star and its planets},

Flares may erode exoplanets' atmospheres and impact their habitability, but might also trigger the genesis of life around small stars. TESS provides a new sample of bright dwarf stars in our galactic neighborhood, collecting data for thousands of M dwarfs that might host habitable exoplanets. Here, we use an automated search for flares accompanied by visual inspection. Then, our public allesfitter code robustly selects the appropriate model for potentially complex flares via Bayesian evidence. We identify 1228 flaring stars, 673 of which are M dwarfs. Among 8695 flares in total, the largest superflare increased the stellar brightness by a factor of 16.1. Bolometric flare energies range from 1031.0 to 1036.9 erg, with a median of 1033.1 erg. Furthermore, we study the flare rate and energy as a function of stellar type and rotation period. We solidify past findings that fast rotating M dwarfs are the most likely to flare and that their flare amplitude is independent of the rotation period. Finally, we link our results to criteria for prebiotic chemistry, atmospheric loss through coronal mass ejections, and ozone sterilization. Four of our flaring M dwarfs host exoplanet candidates alerted on by TESS, for which we discuss how these effects can impact life. With upcoming TESS data releases, our flare analysis can be expanded to almost all bright small stars, aiding in defining criteria for exoplanet habitability.},

This is also the case of Uranus and Neptune, based on available, limited data on these planets.

  abstract = {New sets of young M dwarfs with complex, sharp-peaked, and strictly periodic photometric modulations have recently been discovered with Kepler/K2 (scallop shells) and TESS (complex rotators). All are part of star-forming associations, are distinct from other variable stars, and likely belong to a unified class. Suggested hypotheses include starspots, accreting dust disks, corotating clouds of material, magnetically constrained material, spots and misaligned disks, and pulsations. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview and add new observational constraints with TESS and SPECULOOS Southern Observatory photometry. We scrutinize all hypotheses from three new angles: (1) We investigate each scenario's occurrence rates via young star catalogs, (2) we study the feature's longevity using over one year of combined data, and (3) we probe the expected color dependency with multicolor photometry. In this process, we also revisit the stellar parameters accounting for activity effects, study stellar flares as activity indicators over year-long timescales, and develop toy models to simulate typical morphologies. We rule out most hypotheses, and only (i) corotating material clouds and (ii) spots and misaligned disks remain feasible-with caveats. For (i), corotating dust might not be stable enough, while corotating gas alone likely cannot cause percentage-scale features and (ii) would require misaligned disks around most young M dwarfs. We thus suggest a unified hypothesis, a superposition of large-amplitude spot modulations and sharp transits of corotating gas clouds. While the complex rotators' mystery remains, these new observations add valuable pieces to the puzzle going forward.},

  abstract = {We investigate the orbital evolution of planetesimals in the inner disk in the presence of nebula gas and a (proto-) cold Jupiter. By varying the mass, eccentricity, and semi-major axis of the planet, we study the dependence of the relative velocities of the planetesimals on these parameters. For classic small planetesimals (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{20\} \$g) whose mutual gravitational interaction is negligible, gas drag introduces a size-dependent alignment of orbits and keeps the relative velocity low for similar-size bodies, while preventing orbital alignment for different-size planetesimals. Regardless of the location and the mass ratio of the planetesimals, increasing the mass and eccentricity or decreasing the orbital distance of the planet always leads to higher relative velocities of planetesimals. However, for massive planetesimals, the interplay of viscous stirring, gas damping, and secular perturbation results in lower velocity dispersion of equal-size planetesimals when the planet is more massive or when it is located on a closer or more eccentric orbit. The random velocities of such planetesimals remain almost unperturbed when the planet is located beyond Jupiter's current orbit, or when it is less massive or less eccentric than Jupiter. Unlike small planetesimals, such large planetesimals can grow in a runaway fashion as in the unperturbed case. Our results imply that the presence of a cold Jupiter does not impede the formation of inner rocky planets through planetesimal accretion, provided that the planetesimals are initially large.},

This warm Jupiter was first detected and identified as a promising candidate from a search for single-transit signals in TESS Sector 20 data, and was later characterized as a planet following two subsequent transits (TESS Sectors 26 and 53) and follow-up ground-based RV observations with the NEID and SOPHIE spectrographs. We jointly fit the transit and RV data to constrain the physical (, ) and orbital parameters of the exoplanet. Given its high orbital eccentricity (), TOI-4127 b is a compelling candidate for studies of warm Jupiter populations and of hot Jupiter formation pathways. We show that the present periastron separation of TOI-4127 b is too large for high-eccentricity tidal migration to circularize its orbit, and that TOI-4127 b is unlikely to be a hot Jupiter progenitor unless it is undergoing angular momentum exchange with an undetected outer companion. Although we find no evidence for an external companion, the available observational data are insufficient to rule out the presence of a perturber that can excite eccentricity oscillations and facilitate tidal migration.},

Here, we estimate how much methane may be produced in hydrothermal vent systems by serpentinization, its main geological source, using the kinetic properties of the main reactions involved in methane production by serpentinization. Hydrogen production by serpentinization was calculated as a function of the available FeO in the crust, given the current spreading rates. Carbon dioxide is the limiting reactant for methane formation because it is highly depleted in aqueous form in hydrothermal vent systems. We estimated maximum CH4 surface fluxes of 6.8{\texttimes}108 and 1.3{\texttimes}109 molecules cm-2 s-1 for rocky planets with 1 and 5 M{$\oplus$}, respectively. Using a 1-D photochemical model, we simulated atmospheres with volume mixing ratios of 0.03 and 0.1 CO2 to calculate atmospheric methane concentrations for the maximum production of this compound by serpentinization. The resulting abundances were 2.5 and 2.1\,ppmv for 1 M{$\oplus$} planets and 4.1 and 3.7\,ppmv for 5 M{$\oplus$} planets. Therefore, low atmospheric concentrations of methane may be produced by serpentinization. For habitable planets around Sun-like stars with N2-CO2 atmospheres, methane concentrations larger than 10\,ppmv may indicate the presence of life.

We confirm and characterize these two planets with a variety of ground-based and follow-up observations, including photometry, precise radial velocity monitoring and high-resolution imaging. The planetary and orbital parameters were derived from a joint analysis of the radial velocities and photometric data. We found that the two planets have masses of \$(57 {\textbackslash}pm 4)\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ or \$(0.18 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01)\$ \$M\_J\$, and \$(68 {\textbackslash}pm 4)\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ or \$(0.21 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01)\$ \$M\_J\$, respectively, and they have radii of \$(6.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3)\$ \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ or \$(0.61 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03)\$ \$R\_J\$ and \$(7.2 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$ \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ or \$(0.64 {\textbackslash}pm 0.05)\$ \$R\_J\$, respectively. These parameters correspond to sub-Saturns within the Neptunian desert, both planets being hot and highly irradiated, with \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eq\} {\textbackslash}approx 745\$ \$K\$ and \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eq\} {\textbackslash}approx 1812\$ \$K\$, respectively, assuming a Bond albedo of 0.5. TOI-3071 b has the hottest equilibrium temperature of all known planets with masses between \$10\$ and \$300\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and radii less than \$1.5\$ \$R\_J\$. By applying gas giant evolution models we found that both planets, especially TOI-3071 b, are very metal-rich. This challenges standard formation models which generally predict lower heavy-element masses for planets with similar characteristics. We studied the evolution of the planets' atmospheres under photoevaporation and concluded that both are stable against evaporation due to their large masses and likely high metallicities in their gaseous envelopes.},

Here, we report on the detection of strong H{$\alpha$} emission from two distinct locations in the PDS 70 system, one corresponding to the previously discovered planet PDS 70 b, which confirms the earlier H{$\alpha$} detection8, and another located close to the outer edge of the gap, coinciding with a previously identified bright dust spot in the disk and with a small opening in a ring of molecular emission6,7,9. We identify this second H{$\alpha$} peak as a second protoplanet in the PDS 70 system. The H{$\alpha$} emission spectra of both protoplanets indicate ongoing accretion onto the protoplanets10,11, which appear to be near a 2:1 mean motion resonance. Our observations show that adaptive-optics-assisted, medium-resolution integral field spectroscopy with MUSE12 targeting accretion signatures will be a powerful way to trace ongoing planet formation in transitional disks at different stages of their evolution. Finding more young planetary systems in mean motion resonance would give credibility to the Grand Tack hypothesis in which Jupiter and Saturn migrated in a resonance orbit during the early formation period of our Solar System13.},

  abstract = {Starlink is a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) which aims to provide global satellite internet access. Thus far, most photometric observations of Starlink satellites have primarily been from citizen scientists' visual observations without using quantitative detectors. This paper aims to characterize Starlink satellites and investigate the impact of mega constellations on ground-based astronomy, considering both the observed magnitude and two-line element (TLE) residuals. We collected 353 observations of 61 different Starlink satellites over a 16-month period and we found an average GAIA G magnitude of 5.5~{\textpm}~0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.12. The average magnitude of V1.0 (pre-VisorSat) Starlinks was 5.1~{\textpm}~0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.13. SpaceX briefly used a low-albedo coating on a Starlink satellite called DarkSat to test light pollution mitigation technologies. The brightness of DarkSat was found to be 7.3~{\textpm}~0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.78, or 7.6 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. This concept was later abandoned due to thermal control issues and sun visors were used in future models called VisorSats. The brightness of VisorSats was found to be 6.0~{\textpm}~0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.79, or 2.3 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. Over the span of the observations, we found that TLEs were accurate to within an average of 0.12 degrees in right ascension and --0.08 degrees in declination. The error is predominantly along-track, corresponding to a 0.3 second time error between the observed and TLE trajectories. Our observations show that a time difference of 0.3~{\textpm}~0.28 seconds is viable for a proposed 10 second shutter closure time to avoid Starlinks in images.},

  abstract = {It may be possible to detect biosignatures of photosynthesis in an exoplanet's atmosphere. However, such a detection would likely require a dedicated study, occupying a large amount of telescope time. It is therefore prudent, while searching for signs of life that we may recognise, to pick the best target possible. In this work, we present a new region, the ``photosynthetic habitable zone'' - the distance from a star where both liquid water and oxygenic photosynthesis can occur. It is therefore the region where detectable biosignatures of oxygenic photosynthesis are most likely to occur. Our analysis indicates that in the most ideal conditions for life and no atmospheric and greenhouse effects, the photosynthetic habitable zone is almost as broad as the habitable zone. On the other hand, if conditions for life are anything less than excellent and atmospheric attenuation and greenhouse effects are even moderate, the photosynthetic habitable zone is concentrated at larger separations around more massive stars. Such cases are also not tidally locked to their host star, which could result in planetary rotation periods similar to the Earth's. We identify five planets, Kepler-452 b, Kepler-1638 b, Kepler-1544 b and Kepler-62 e and Kepler-62 f, that are consistently in the photosynthetic habitable zone for a variety of conditions, and we predict their day lengths to be between 9 and 11 hours. We conclude that the parameter space in which we should search for signs of life is much narrower than the standard habitable zone.},

  abstract = {We present the thermal evolution and emergent spectra of solidifying terrestrial planets along with the formation of steam atmospheres. The lifetime of a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the orbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a Type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal emission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately 106 years. Therefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in this orbital region. In contrast, a Type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared atmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L bands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star contrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10-7--10-8. Our model predicts that, in the Type II orbital region, molten planets would be present over the main sequence of the G-type host star if the initial bulk content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt\%. In visible atmospheric windows, the contrasts of the thermal emission drop below 10-10 in less than 105 years, whereas those of the reflected light remain 10-10 for both types of planets. Since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light from Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the visible reflected light from molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with future ground- and space-based telescopes.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing detections of atmospheres. One way to find atmospheres is to search for lower dayside emission than would be expected for a blackbody planet. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for nightside emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. Here, we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters for a range of surfaces (providing our open-access albedo data) and atmospheres on 30 exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. We show that secondary eclipse observations are more degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres than suggested in previous work, and that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a blackbody planet in these filters. These results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric dayside emission alone. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets. While phase curves are time-consuming and their instrumental systematics can be challenging, we suggest that they allow the only unambiguous detections of atmospheres by nightside thermal emission.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Context: In the previous paper in this series, we identified that a pentagonal arrangement of five telescopes, using a kernel-nulling beam combiner, shows notable advantages for some important performance metrics for a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer over several other considered configurations for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets around solar-type stars. Aims: We aim to produce a practical implementation of a kernel-nulling beam combiner for such a configuration, as well as a discussion of systematic and stochastic errors associated with the instrument. Methods: We develop the mathematical framework around a beam-combiner based on a nulling combiner first suggested by Guyon et al. (2013), and then use it along with the simulator developed in the previous paper to identify the effects of systematic uncertainties. Results: We find that errors in the beam combiner optics, systematic phase errors and the RMS fringe tracking errors result in instrument limited performance at \${\textbackslash}sim\$4-7 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, and zodiacal limited at \$rsim\$10 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. Assuming a beam splitter reflectance error of \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta R{\textbar} = 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ and phase shift error of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}phi = 3\$ degrees, we find that the fringe tracking RMS should be kept to less than 3 nm in order to be photon limited, and the systematic piston error be less than 0.5 nm to be appropriately sensitive to planets with a contrast of 1\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ over a 4-19 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m bandpass. We also identify that the beam combiner design, with the inclusion of a well positioned shutter, provides an ability to produce robust kernel observables even if one or two collecting telescopes were to fail. The resulting four telescope combiner, when put into an X-array formation, results in a transmission map with an relative SNR equivalent to 80\% of the fully functioning X-array combiner.},

This argument, often referred to as the Fermi paradox, typically assumes that expansion would proceed uniformly through the Galaxy, but not all stellar types may be equally useful for a long-lived civilization. We suggest that low-mass stars, and K-dwarf stars in particular, would be ideal migration locations for civilizations that originate in a G-dwarf system. We use a modified form of the Drake equation to show that expansion across all low-mass stars could be accomplished in 2 Gyr, which includes waiting time between expansion waves to allow for a close approach to a suitable destination star. This would require interstellar travel capabilities of no more than {$\sim$}0.3 lt-yr to settle all M-dwarfs and {$\sim$}2 lt-yr to settle all K-dwarfs. Even more rapid expansion could occur within 2 Myr, with travel requirements of {$\sim$}10 lt-yr to settle all M-dwarfs and {$\sim$}50 lt-yr to settle all K-dwarfs. The search for technosignatures in exoplanetary systems can help to place constraints on the presence of such a ``low-mass Galactic Club'' in the Galaxy today.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} It is common practice to claim the detection of a signal if, for a certain statistical significance metric, the signal significance exceeds a certain threshold fixed in advance. In the context of exoplanet searches in radial velocity data, the most common statistical significance metrics are the Bayes factor and the false alarm probability (FAP). Both criteria have proved useful, but do not directly address whether an exoplanet detection should be claimed. Furthermore, it is unclear which detection threshold should be taken and how robust the detections are to model misspecification.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The aim of the present work is to define a detection criterion that conveys as precisely as possible the information needed to claim an exoplanet detection, as well as efficient numerical methods to compute it. We compare this new criterion to existing ones in terms of sensitivity and robustness to a change in the model.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We define a general detection criterion called the false inclusion probability (FIP). In the context of exoplanet detections it provides the posterior probability of presence of a planet with a period in a certain interval. Posterior distributions are computed with the nested sampling package POLYCHORD. We show that for FIP and Bayes factor calculations, defining priors on linear parameters as Gaussian mixture models can significantly speed up computations. The performance of the FAP, Bayes factor, and FIP are studied via simulations and analytical arguments. We compare the methods assuming the model is correct, then evaluate their sensitivity to the prior and likelihood choices.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Among other properties, the FIP offers ways to test the reliability of the significance levels; it is a particularly efficient way to account for aliasing, and it allows the presence of planets to be excluded with a certain confidence. In our simulations, we find that the FIP outperforms existing detection metrics. We show that low amplitude planet detections are sensitive to priors on period and semi-amplitude, which will require further attention for the detection of Earth-like planets. We recommend to let the parameters of the noise model free in the analysis, rather than fixing a noise model based on a fit to ancillary indicators.}}}}},

We find no evidence of significant signals at the detected period in spectroscopic stellar activity indicators or MEarth photometry. The planet, Ross 508 b, has a semimajor-axis of \$0.05366{\textasciicircum}\{+0.00056\}\_\{-0.00049\}\$ au. This gives an orbit-averaged insolation of \${\textbackslash}approx\$1.4 times the Earth's value, placing Ross 508 b near the inner edge of its star's habitable zone. We have explored the possibility that the planet has a high eccentricity and its host is accompanied by an additional unconfirmed companion on a wide orbit. Our discovery demonstrates that the near-infrared RV search can play a crucial role to find a low-mass planet around cool M dwarfs like Ross 508.},

  abstract = {Molecular oxygen is a strong indicator of life on Earth and may indicate biological processes on exoplanets too. Recent studies proposed that Earth-like O2 levels might be detectable on nearby exoplanets using high-resolution spectrographs on future extremely large telescopes (ELTs). However, these studies did not consider constraints like relative velocities, planet occurrence rates, and target observability. We expanded on past studies by creating a homogeneous catalog of 286,391 main-sequence stars within 120 pc using Gaia DR3 and used the Bioverse framework to simulate the likelihood of finding nearby transiting Earth analogs. We also simulated a survey of M dwarfs within 20 pc accounting for {$\eta$} {$\oplus$} estimates, transit probabilities, relative velocities, and target observability to determine how long ELTs and theoretical 50--100 m ground-based telescopes need to observe to probe for Earth-like O2 levels with an R = 100,000 spectrograph. This would only be possible within 50 yr for up to {$\sim$}21\% of nearby M-dwarf systems if a suitable transiting habitable-zone Earth analog was discovered, assuming signals from every observable partial transit from each ELT can be combined. If so, Earth-like O2 levels could be detectable on TRAPPIST-1 d--g within 16--55 yr, respectively, and about half that time with an R = 500,000 spectrograph. These results have important implications for whether ELTs can survey nearby habitable-zone Earth analogs for O2 via transmission spectroscopy. Our work provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of the ground-based capabilities to search for life beyond the solar system.

  abstract = {Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O2 levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exo-Earth candidates (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Assuming continued improvement in instruments and data processing, our analysis highlights the best-case scenarios. Earth-like O2 levels could be probed on up to {$\sim$}7 and {$\sim$}19 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a hypothetical 10 yr survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, could be probed for O2 within about 1 week of observations on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis---that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O2---within a 10 yr survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either {$\sim$}one-half of the EECs to have O2 or {$\sim$}one-third if {$\eta\oplus$} is large. A Northern Hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope, would expand the target star pool by about 25\%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The program took into account changes in the solar luminosity, variations in the Earth's albedo, the greenhouse effect, variation in the biomass, and a variety of geochemical processes. Results indicate that prior to two billion years ago the Earth had a partially reduced atmosphere, which included N2, CO2, reduced carbon compounds, some NH3, but no free H2. Surface temperatures were higher than now, due to a large greenhouse effect. When free O2 appeared the temperature fell sharply. Had Earth been only slightly further from the Sun, runaway glaciation would have occured at that time. Simulations also indicate that a runaway greenhouse would have occured early in Earth's history had Earth been only a few percent closer to the Sun. It therefore appears that, taking into account the possibilities of either runaway glaciation or a runaway greenhouse effect, the continously habitable zone about a solar-type star is rather narrow, extending only from roughly 0.95 to 1.01 AU.},

We present unpopular, an open-source Python package to obtain detrended TESS FFI light curves optimized for variable sources. The unpopular package implements a variant of the causal pixel model to remove systematics and allows for simultaneous fitting with a polynomial component to capture nontransit astrophysical variations, such as supernova signals or stellar variability, that tend to be removed in techniques optimized for exoplanet detection. We validate our method by detrending different sources (e.g., supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), exoplanet-hosting stars, fast-rotating stars) and comparing our light curves to those obtained by other pipelines when appropriate. Our supernova and TDE light curves are visually similar to those obtained by others using the ISIS image subtraction package, indicating that unpopular can be used to extract multisector light curves by preserving astrophysical signals on timescales of a TESS sector ({\textasciitilde}27 days). We note that our method contains tuning parameters that are currently set heuristically, and that the optimal set of tuning parameters will likely depend on the particular signal the user is interested in obtaining. The unpopular source code and tutorials are freely available online.},

  abstract = {A foundational idea in the theory of in situ planet formation is the "minimum mass extrasolar nebula" (MMEN), a surface density profile (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\$) of disk solids that is necessary to form the planets in their present locations. While most previous studies have fit a single power-law to all exoplanets in an observed ensemble, it is unclear whether most exoplanetary systems form from a universal disk template. We use an advanced statistical model for the underlying architectures of multi-planet systems to reconstruct the MMEN. The simulated physical and Kepler-observed catalogs allows us to directly assess the role of detection biases, and in particular the effect of non-transiting or otherwise undetected planets, on altering the inferred MMEN. We find that fitting a power-law of the form \${\textbackslash}Sigma = {\textbackslash}Sigma\_0{\textasciicircum}* (a/a\_0){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$ to each multi-planet system results in a broad distribution of disk profiles; \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_0{\textasciicircum}* = 336\_\{-291\}{\textasciicircum}\{+727\}\$ g/cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta = -1.98\_\{-1.52\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.55\}\$ encompasses the 16th-84th percentiles of the marginal distributions in an underlying population, where \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_0{\textasciicircum}*\$ is the normalization at \$a\_0 = 0.3\$ AU. Around half of inner planet-forming disks have minimum solid masses of \$rsim 40 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ within 1 AU. While transit observations do not tend to bias the median \${\textbackslash}beta\$, they can lead to both significantly over- and under-estimated \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_0{\textasciicircum}*\$ and thus broaden the inferred distribution of disk masses. Nevertheless, detection biases cannot account for the full variance in the observed disk profiles; there is no universal MMEN if all planets formed in situ. The great diversity of solid disk profiles suggests that a substantial fraction of planetary systems experienced a history of migration.},

While the correlation coefficient could change depending on the statistical analysis, the statistical significance of the correlation is robust. Further analysis shows that the correlation originates from two contributing factors. One seems to be a power-law dependence between the two quantities for intermediate periods (3--100~d), and the other is a dearth of planets with radii larger than 2 R{$\oplus$} in short periods. This correlation may provide important constraints for small-planet formation theories and for understanding the dynamical evolution of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {The Juno mission has revolutionized and challenged our understanding of Jupiter. As Juno transitioned to its extended mission, we review the major findings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant to understanding Jupiter's formation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's interior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is accordingly non-adiabatic, with a complex internal structure. These new results imply that current models of Jupiter's formation and evolution require a revision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths that can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the constraints they provide. We note that standard core accretion formation models, including the heavy-element enrichment during planetary growth is consistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition gradients in its deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this region, which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to about 10\% of Jupiter's total mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno data imply that this region contains 30\% of the mass or more. One way to explain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long (about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and planetesimals delaying the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact or convection post-formation. These novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions. Clarity on the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution observations of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed and modeled architectures of extrasolar systems with giant planets, and future Juno data obtained during its extended mission.},

  abstract = {The detection of moons orbiting extrasolar planets (``exomoons'') has now become feasible. Once they are discovered in the circumstellar habitable zone, questions about their habitability will emerge. Exomoons are likely to be tidally locked to their planet and hence experience days much shorter than their orbital period around the star and have seasons, all of which works in favor of habitability. These satellites can receive more illumination per area than their host planets, as the planet reflects stellar light and emits thermal photons. On the contrary, eclipses can significantly alter local climates on exomoons by reducing stellar illumination. In addition to radiative heating, tidal heating can be very large on exomoons, possibly even large enough for sterilization. We identify combinations of physical and orbital parameters for which radiative and tidal heating are strong enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse. By analogy with the circumstellar habitable zone, these constraints define a circumplanetary ``habitable edge.'' We apply our model to hypothetical moons around the recently discovered exoplanet Kepler-22b and the giant planet candidate KOI211.01 and describe, for the first time, the orbits of habitable exomoons. If either planet hosted a satellite at a distance greater than 10 planetary radii, then this could indicate the presence of a habitable moon.

  abstract = {The diversity and quantity of moons in the Solar System suggest a manifold population of natural satellites exist around extrasolar planets. Of peculiar interest from an astrobiological perspective, the number of sizable moons in the stellar habitable zones may outnumber planets in these circumstellar regions. With technological and theoretical methods now allowing for the detection of sub-Earth-sized extrasolar planets, the first detection of an extrasolar moon appears feasible. In this review, we summarize formation channels of massive exomoons that are potentially detectable with current or near-future instruments. We discuss the orbital effects that govern exomoon evolution, we present a framework to characterize an exomoon's stellar plus planetary illumination as well as its tidal heating, and we address the techniques that have been proposed to search for exomoons. Most notably, we show that natural satellites in the range of 0.1--0.5 Earth mass (i) are potentially habitable, (ii) can form within the circumplanetary debris and gas disk or via capture from a binary, and (iii) are detectable with current technology.

  abstract = {Despite years of high accuracy observations, none of the available theoretical techniques has yet allowed the confirmation of a moon beyond the solar system. Methods are currently limited to masses about an order of magnitude higher than the mass of any moon in the solar system. I here present a new method sensitive to exomoons similar to the known moons. Due to the projection of transiting exomoon orbits onto the celestial plane, satellites appear more often at larger separations from their planet. After about a dozen randomly sampled observations, a photometric orbital sampling effect (OSE) starts to appear in the phase-folded transit light curve, indicative of the moons' radii and planetary distances. Two additional outcomes of the OSE emerge in the planet's transit timing variations (TTV-OSE) and transit duration variations (TDV-OSE), both of which permit measurements of a moon's mass. The OSE is the first effect that permits characterization of multi-satellite systems. I derive and apply analytical OSE descriptions to simulated transit observations of the Kepler space telescope assuming white noise only. Moons as small as Ganymede may be detectable in the available data, with M stars being their most promising hosts. Exomoons with the ten-fold mass of Ganymede and a similar composition (about 0.86 Earth radii in radius) can most likely be found in the available Kepler data of K stars, including moons in the stellar habitable zone. A future survey with Kepler-class photometry, such as Plato 2.0, and a permanent monitoring of a single field of view over five years or more will very likely discover extrasolar moons via their OSEs.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope has proven capable of detecting transits of objects almost as small as the Earth's Moon. Some studies suggest that moons as small as 0.2 Earth masses can be detected in the Kepler data by transit timing variations and transit duration variations of their host planets. If such massive moons exist around giant planets in the stellar habitable zone (HZ), then they could serve as habitats for extraterrestrial life. While earlier studies on exomoon habitability assumed the host planet to be in thermal equilibrium with the absorbed stellar flux, we here extend this concept by including the planetary luminosity from evolutionary shrinking. Our aim is to assess the danger of exomoons to be in a runaway greenhouse state due to extensive heating from the planet. We apply pre-computed evolution tracks for giant planets to calculate the incident planetary radiation on the moon as a function of time. Added to the stellar flux, the total illumination yields constraints on a moon's habitability. Ultimately, we include tidal heating to evaluate a moon's energy budget. We use a semi-analytical formula to parameterize the critical flux for the moon to experience a runaway greenhouse effect. Planetary illumination from a 13-Jupiter-mass planet onto an Earth-sized moon at a distance of ten Jupiter radii can drive a runaway greenhouse state on the moon for about 200 million years (Myr). When stellar illumination equivalent to that received by Earth from the Sun is added, then the runaway greenhouse holds for about 500~Myr. After 1000~Myr, the planet's habitable edge has moved inward to about six Jupiter radii. Exomoons in orbits with eccentricities of 0.1 experience strong tidal heating; they must orbit a 13-Jupiter-mass host beyond 29 or 18 Jupiter radii after 100~Myr (at the inner and outer boundaries of the stellar HZ, respectively), and beyond 13 Jupiter radii (in both cases) after 1000~Myr to be habitable. If a roughly Earth-sized, Earth-mass moon would be detected in orbit around a giant planet, and if the planet--moon duet would orbit in the stellar HZ, then it will be crucial to recover the orbital history of the moon. If, for example, such a moon around a 13-Jupiter-mass planet has been closer than 20 Jupiter radii to its host during the first few hundred million years at least, then it might have lost substantial amounts of its initial water reservoir and be uninhabitable today.},

  abstract = {In its long-duration observation phase, the PLATO satellite will observe two non-overlapping fields for a total of 4 yr. The exact duration of each pointing will be determined 2 yr before launch. Previous estimates of PLATO's yield of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones (HZs) around solar-type stars ranged between 6 and 280. We use the PLATO Solar-like Light curve Simulator (PSLS) to simulate light curves with transiting planets around bright (m\_V {$>$} 11) Sun-like stars at a cadence of 25 s, roughly representative of the {$>$}15,000 targets in PLATO's high-priority P1 sample (mostly F5-K7 dwarfs and sub-dwarfs). Our study includes light curves generated from synchronous observations of 6, 12, 18, and 24 of PLATO's 12 cm aperture cameras over both 2 yr and 3 yr of continuous observations. Automated detrending is done with the Wotan software and post-detrending transit detection is performed with the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. We scale the true positive rates (TPRs) with the expected number of stars in the P1 sample and with modern estimates of the exoplanet occurrence rates and predict the detection of planets with 0.5 R\_E {$<$}= R\_p {$<$}= 1.5 R\_E in the HZs around F5-K7 dwarf stars. For the (2 yr + 2 yr) long-duration observation phase strategy we predict 11-34 detections, for the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy we predict 8-25 discoveries. Our study of the effects of stellar variability on shallow transits of Earth-like planets illustrates that our estimates of PLATO's planet yield, which we derive using a photometrically quiet star like the Sun, must be seen as upper limits. In conclusion, PLATO's detection of about a dozen Earth-sized planets in the HZs around solar-type stars will mean a major contribution to this yet poorly sampled part of the exoplanet parameter space with Earth-like planets.},

Barnard's star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO GTO as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the {$\alpha$} Centauri stellar system.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO observations of Barnard's star carried out over four years with the goal of exploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone (HZ).\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model stellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200 d and confirms stellar activity due to rotation at 140 d as the dominant source of radial velocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on publicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not support the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233 d.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} After subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period candidate planet signals at periods of 3.15 d, 4.12 d, 2.34 d, and 6.74 d. We confirm the 3.15 d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of 55 {\textpm} 7 cm s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, leading to a planet minimum mass \emph{m\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$><$}i/{$>$} sin \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} of 0.37 {\textpm} 0.05 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, which is about three times the mass of Mars.

Peer review has limitations, including bias against risky proposals or interdisciplinary research. The inter-rater reliability between reviewers and panels is low, particularly for proposals near the funding line. Funding agencies are also increasingly acknowledging the role of chance. The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) introduced a lottery for proposals in the middle group of good but not excellent proposals. In this article, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model for the evaluation process. To rank the proposals, we estimate their expected ranks (ER), which incorporates both the magnitude and uncertainty of the estimated differences between proposals. A provisional funding line is defined based on ER and budget. The ER and its credible interval are used to identify proposals with similar quality and credible intervals that overlap with the funding line. These proposals are entered into a lottery. We illustrate the approach for two SNSF grant schemes in career and project funding. We argue that the method could reduce bias in the evaluation process.

  abstract = {The Earth's deep interior contains significant reservoirs of volatiles such as H, C, and N. Due to the incompatible nature of these volatile species, it has been difficult to reconcile their storage in the residual mantle immediately following crystallization of the terrestrial magma ocean (MO). As the magma ocean freezes, it is commonly assumed that very small amounts of melt are retained in the residual mantle, limiting the trapped volatile concentration in the primordial mantle. In this article, we show that inefficient melt drainage out of the freezing front can retain large amounts of volatiles hosted in the trapped melt in the residual mantle while creating a thick early atmosphere. Using a two-phase flow model, we demonstrate that compaction within the moving freezing front is inefficient over time scales characteristic of magma ocean solidification. We employ a scaling relation between the trapped melt fraction, the rate of compaction, and the rate of freezing in our magma ocean evolution model. For cosmochemically plausible fractions of volatiles delivered during the later stages of accretion, our calculations suggest that up to 77\% of total H2O and 12\% of CO2 could have been trapped in the mantle during magma ocean crystallization. The assumption of a constant trapped melt fraction underestimates the mass of volatiles in the residual mantle by more than an order of magnitude.},

These include highly eccentric orbits, giant planets, different bulk densities, relatively active stars, and evolved stars. This work catalogs all planets found to reside in the habitable zone (HZ) and provides HZ boundaries, orbit characterization, and the potential for spectroscopic follow-up observations. Demographics of the HZ planets are compared with a full catalog of exoplanets. Extreme planets within the HZ are highlighted, and how their unique properties may affect their potential habitability is discussed. Kepler-296 f is the most eccentric {$\leq$}2 R {$\oplus$} planet that spends 100\% of its orbit in the HZ. HD 106270 b and HD 38529 c are the most massive planets ({$\leq$}13 M J) that orbit within the HZ, and are ideal targets for determining the properties of potential hosts of HZ exomoons. These planets, along with the others highlighted, will serve as special edge cases to the Earth-based scenario, and observations of these targets will help test the resilience of habitability outside the standard model. The most promising observational HZ target that is known to transit is GJ 414 A b. Of the transiting, {$\leq$}2 R {$\oplus$} HZ planets, LHS 1140 b, TRAPPIST-1 d, and K2-3 d are the most favorable. Of the nontransiting HZ planets, HD 102365 b and 55 Cnc f are the most promising, and the best nontransiting candidates that have {$\leq$}2 R {$\oplus$} are GJ 667 C c, Wolf 1061 c, Ross 508 b, Teegarden's Star b, and Proxima Cen b.},

  abstract = {Long term precise radial velocity (RV) monitoring of HD206893, as well as anomalies in the system proper motion, have suggested the presence of an additional, inner companion in the system. In this work we describe the results of a search for the companion responsible for this RV drift and proper motion anomaly. Utilizing information from ongoing precision RV measurements with the HARPS spectrograph, as well as Gaia host star astrometry, we have undertaken a multi-epoch search for the purported additional planet using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We report a high significance detection of the purported companion HD206893c over three epochs, with clear evidence for Keplerian orbital motion. Our astrometry with \${\textbackslash}sim\$50-100 \${\textbackslash}mu\$arcsec precision afforded by GRAVITY allows us to derive a dynamical mass of 12.3\${\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.2\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ and an orbital separation of 3.53\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.80\}\_\{-0.70\}\$ au for HD206893c. Our fits to the orbits of both companions in the system utilize both Gaia astrometry and RVs to also provide a precise dynamical estimate of the previously uncertain mass of the B component, and therefore derive an age of 170 Myr. Importantly, we find that the bolometric luminosity of the newly discovered HD206893c is anomalously high, and that standard cooling curves are unable to simultaneously account for the brightness of both members of the system at a common age of 170 Myr. However, we find that incorporating an elevated helium abundance into our cooling models in turn results in an enhanced level of deuterium burning in the "c" companion, bringing the predicted luminosity in line with our measured value. In addition to utilizing long-term RV information, this effort is an early example of a direct imaging discovery of a bona fide exoplanet that was guided in part with Gaia astrometry.},

We test a recently developed method for exomoon search, the orbital sampling effect (OSE), using the full exoplanet photometry from the Kepler Space Telescope. The OSE is applied to phase-folded transits, for which we present a framework to detect false positives, and discuss four candidates which pass several of our tests. Using numerical simulations, we inject exomoon signals into real Kepler data and retrieve them, showing that under favorable conditions, exomoons can be found with Kepler and the OSE method. In addition, we super-stack a large sample of Kepler planets to search for the average exomoon OSE and the accompanying increase in noise, the scatter peak. We find a significant OSE-like signal, which might indicate the presence of moons, for planets with , having an average dip per planet of 6 {\textpm} 2 ppm, corresponding to a moon radius of km for the average star radius of 1.24 in this sample.},

  abstract = {The detection of transiting exoplanets in time-series photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in W{\=o}tan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

We may assume that this general property is common to all life in the solar system. On this assumption, evidence of a large chemical free energy gradient between surface matter and the atmosphere in contact with it is evidence of life. Furthermore, any planetary biota which interacts with its atmosphere will drive that atmosphere to a state of disequilibrium which, if recognized, would also constitute direct evidence of life, provided the extent of the disequilibrium is significantly greater than abiological processes would permit. It is shown that the existence of life on Earth can be inferred from knowledge of the major and trace components of the atmosphere, even in the absence of any knowledge of the nature or extent of the dominant life forms. Knowledge of the composition of the Martian atmosphere may similarly reveal the presence of life there.},

Thus, the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed value of MT sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e., the presumptive prior distribution. Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn depends on the intrinsic distribution of MT for the exoplanet population being studied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several ``toy models'' for the intrinsic distribution of MT, on which we have significant information from available RV data in some mass ranges but little or none in others. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for simple power-law distributions of MT, the median value of sin(i) in an observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the 0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of indices, the 95\% confidence interval on MT varies from 1.0001--2.405 ({$\alpha$} = -2) to 1.13--94.34 ({$\alpha$} = +2) times larger than MT sin(i) due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of MT yield more complicated and somewhat unintuitive posterior sin(i) distributions. In particular, if the MT distribution contains any characteristic mass scale Mc, the posterior sin(i) distribution will depend on the ratio of MT sin(i) to Mc, often in a non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets, both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i) factor as more than a ``numerical constant of order unity'' with simple and well-understood statistical properties. We argue that reports of MT sin(i) determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding confidence bounds on MT at, say, the 95\% level based on an explicitly stated assumed form of the true MT distribution in order to reflect more accurately the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.},

A dynamical systems framework provides additional insight into the vertical dynamics of the atmospheres. Indeed, we demonstrate that adding CO2 increases temporal stability near the surface and decreases stability at low pressures.

  abstract = {Temperature-dependent biological productivity controls silicate weathering and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan of Earth. Models and theoretical considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H\$\_2\$O and CO\$\_2\$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation of space telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone could then give insights into whether the planet is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly compensated for by an increased supply rate of CO\$\_2\$ to the atmosphere. Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ near the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets with active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse. For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity also leads to a CH\$\_4\$ biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable, the H\$\_2\$O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-micron CO\$\_2\$ band remains a clear window into the CO\$\_2\$ abundances. In summary, while the effect of life on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future work is needed especially to determine the tectonic state and composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of the next generation of space telescopes.},

  abstract = {Temperature-dependent biological productivity controls silicate weathering and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan of Earth. Models and theoretical considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O and CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}, which might be observed with the upcoming generation of space telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone could then give insights into whether the planet is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly compensated for by an increased supply rate of CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} to the atmosphere. Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} near the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets with active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse. For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity also leads to a CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$} biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable, the H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-{\textmu}m CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} band remains a clear window into the CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} abundances. In summary, while the effect of life on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future work is needed especially to determine the tectonic state and composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of the next generation of space telescopes.}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {JWST has ushered in an era of unprecedented ability to characterize exoplanetary atmospheres. While there are over 5,000 confirmed planets, more than 4,000 TESS planet candidates are still unconfirmed and many of the best planets for atmospheric characterization may remain to be identified. We present a sample of TESS planets and planet candidates that we identify as "best-in-class" for transmission and emission spectroscopy with JWST. These targets are sorted into bins across equilibrium temperature \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eq\}\}\$ and planetary radius \$R\{\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\}\$ and are ranked by transmission and emission spectroscopy metric (TSM and ESM, respectively) within each bin. In forming our target sample, we perform cuts for expected signal size and stellar brightness, to remove sub-optimal targets for JWST. Of the 194 targets in the resulting sample, 103 are unconfirmed TESS planet candidates, also known as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We perform vetting and statistical validation analyses on these 103 targets to determine which are likely planets and which are likely false positives, incorporating ground-based follow-up from the TESS Follow-up Observation Program (TFOP) to aid the vetting and validation process. We statistically validate 23 TOIs, marginally validate 33 TOIs to varying levels of confidence, deem 29 TOIs likely false positives, and leave the dispositions for 4 TOIs as inconclusive. 14 of the 103 TOIs were confirmed independently over the course of our analysis. We provide our final best-in-class sample as a community resource for future JWST proposals and observations. We intend for this work to motivate formal confirmation and mass measurements of each validated planet and encourage more detailed analysis of individual targets by the community.},

  abstract = {Within the next few years, the first Earth-mass planets will be discovered around other stars. Some of those worlds will certainly lie within the classical `habitable zone' of their parent stars, and we will quickly move from knowing of no exoEarths to knowing many. For the first time, we will be in a position to carry out a detailed search for the first evidence of life beyond our Solar System. However, such observations will be hugely taxing and time consuming to perform, and it is almost certain that far more potentially habitable worlds will be known than it is possible to study. It is therefore important to catalogue and consider the various effects that make a promising planet more or less suitable for the development of life. In this work, we review the various planetary, dynamical and stellar influences that could influence the habitability of exoEarths. The various influences must be taken in concert when we attempt to decide where to focus our first detailed search for life. While there is no guarantee that any given planet will be inhabited, it is vitally important to ensure that we focus our time and effort on those planets most likely to yield a positive result.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery and initial characterization of sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets that receive stellar irradiance of approximately Earth's raised the prospect of finding habitable planets in the coming decade, because some of these temperate planets may support liquid-water oceans if they do not have massive H2/He envelopes and are thus not too hot at the bottom of the envelopes. For planets larger than Earth, and especially planets in the 1.7--3.5 R {$\oplus$} population, the mass of the H2/He envelope is typically not sufficiently constrained to assess the potential habitability. Here we show that the solubility equilibria versus thermochemistry of carbon and nitrogen gases typically results in observable discriminators between small H2 atmospheres versus massive ones, because the condition to form a liquid-water ocean and that to achieve the thermochemical equilibrium are mutually exclusive. The dominant carbon and nitrogen gases are typically CH4 and NH3 due to thermochemical recycling in a massive atmosphere of a temperate planet, and those in a small atmosphere overlying a liquid-water ocean are most likely CO2 and N2, followed by CO and CH4 produced photochemically. NH3 is depleted in the small atmosphere by dissolution into the liquid-water ocean. These gases lead to distinctive features in the planet's transmission spectrum, and a moderate number of transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope should tell apart a small atmosphere versus a massive one on planets like K2-18 b. This framework thus points to a way to use near-term facilities to constrain the atmospheric mass and habitability of temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets.},

These observations disfavor a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere27,28. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by JWST's NIRCam and MIRI instruments from 4 to 12 {$\mu$}m. The measurements rule out the scenario where the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock29--32, and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere likely rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean.},

  abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) in a terrestrial planet atmosphere is generally a good biosignature gas, primarily because terrestrial planets have no significant known abiotic NH3 source. The conditions required for NH3 to accumulate in the atmosphere are, however, stringent. NH3's high water solubility and high biousability likely prevent NH3 from accumulating in the atmosphere to detectable levels unless life is a net source of NH3 and produces enough NH3 to saturate the surface sinks. Only then can NH3 accumulate in the atmosphere with a reasonable surface production flux. For the highly favorable planetary scenario of terrestrial planets with hydrogen (H2)-dominated atmospheres orbiting M dwarf stars (M5V), we find that a minimum of about 5\,ppm column-averaged mixing ratio is needed for NH3 to be detectable with JWST, considering a 10\,ppm JWST systematic noise floor. When the surface is saturated with NH3 (i.e., there are no NH3-removal reactions on the surface), the required biological surface flux to reach 5\,ppm is on the order of 1010 molecules/(cm2{$\cdot$}s), comparable with the terrestrial biological production of methane (CH4). However, when the surface is unsaturated with NH3, due to additional sinks present on the surface, life would have to produce NH3 at surface flux levels on the order of 1015 molecules/(cm2{$\cdot$}s) ({$\sim$}4.5\,{\texttimes}\,106 Tg/year). This value is roughly 20,000 times greater than the biological production of NH3 on the Earth and about 10,000 times greater than Earth's CH4 biological production. Volatile amines have similar solubilities and reactivities to NH3 and hence share NH3's weaknesses and strengths as a biosignature. Finally, to establish NH3 as a biosignature gas, we must rule out mini-Neptunes with deep atmospheres, where temperatures and pressures are high enough for NH3's atmospheric production.},

  abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is an 0.09 M{$\odot$} star, which harbours a system of seven Earth-sized planets. Two main features stand out: (i) all planets have similar radii, masses, and compositions; and (ii) all planets are in resonance. Previous works have outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario where planets of similar composition form sequentially at the H2O snowline ({$\sim$}0.1 au for this low-mass star). It was hypothesized that the subsequent formation and migration led to the current resonant configuration. Here, we investigate whether the sequential planet formation model is indeed capable to produce the present-day resonant configuration, characterized by its two-body and three-body mean motion resonances structure. We carry out N-body simulations, accounting for type-I migration, stellar tidal damping, disc eccentricity-damping, and featuring a migration barrier located at the disc's inner edge. Due to the sequential migration, planets naturally form a chain of first-order resonances. But to explain the period ratios of the b/c/d-system, which are presently in higher order resonances, we find that planets b and c must have marched across the migration barrier, into the gas-free cavity, before the disc has dispersed. We investigate both an early and late cavity infall scenario and find that the early infall model best matches the constraints, as well as being more probable. After the dispersal of the gaseous disc, stellar tidal torque also contributes towards a modest separation of the inner system. We outline how the insights obtained in this work can be applied to aid the understanding of other compact resonant planet systems.},

We have found that the atmospheric evolution has two distinctly different outcomes, depending on the rocky body's mass: while the atmospheres on massive rocky bodies undergo runaway disk-gas accretion, those on light rocky bodies undergo significant erosion during disk dispersal. In the atmospheric erosion, the heat content of the rocky body that was previously neglected plays an important role. We have also realized that the atmospheric mass is rather sensitive to disk temperature in the mass range of interest in this study. Our theory is applied to recently detected super-Earths orbiting Kepler-11 to examine the possibility that the planets are rock-dominated ones with relatively thick H--He atmospheres. The application suggests that the in situ formation of the relatively thick H--He atmospheres inferred by structure modeling is possible only under restricted conditions, namely, relatively slow disk dissipation and/or cool environments. This study demonstrates that low-density super-Earths provide important clues to understanding of planetary accretion and disk evolution.},

Water ocean mass is determined as a result not only of water delivery and loss, but also of water partitioning among several reservoirs. Here we review our current understanding of water partitioning among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and solid mantle of accreting planetary embryos and protoplanets just after giant collisions. Magma oceans are readily formed in planetary embryos and protoplanets in their accretion phase. Significant amounts of water are partitioned into magma oceans, provided the planetary building blocks are water-rich enough. Particularly important but still quite uncertain issues are how much water the planetary building blocks contain initially and how water goes out of the solidifying mantle and is finally degassed to the atmosphere. Constraints from both solar-system explorations and exoplanet observations and also from laboratory experiments are needed to resolve these issues.},

Equilibrium therefore requires that the condensed phase evaporates into the atmosphere.Moist adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic atmospheres in which the condensing vapor is a major atmospheric constituent are considered. This situation would apply if the solar constant were supercritical with respect to an abundant substance such as water. It is shown that the condensing gas would be a major constituent at all levels in such an atmosphere. Photodissociation of water in the primordial Venus atmosphere is discussed in this context.},

  abstract = {Following Svitek (Martian Water Frost: Control of Global Distribution by Small-Scale Processes, Ph.D Thesis, California Institute of Technology, 1992), analytic solutions are presented for the effective albedo, the effective emissivity, and the radiative equilibrium temperature in the shadowed portions of a spherical bowl-shaped crater. The model assumes that the surface is a Lambert scatterer with visual albedo and infrared emissivity each independent of wavelength across their respective spectral ranges. Absorption, emission, and multiple scattering from the walls of the crater are treated rigorously to all orders. For airless bodies whose surfaces are in radiative equilibrium, all shadowed portions of any individual crater have the same temperature, whose value depends on four quantities: the insolation (product of the solar constant and the sine of the solar elevation angle), the depth/diameter ratio of the crater, the visual albedo, and the infrared emissivity. As long as the crater is deep enough to have shadows, the lowest temperatures are for the shallowest crater---those with the smallest depth/diameter ratio. The model is applied first to the Moon and Mercury using a depth/diameter ratio of 0.2, which is typical of the lunar highlands according to Pike (Geophys. Res. Lett. 1, 291--294 (1974); in Impact and Explosion Cratering (Roddy et al., Eds.), pp. 489--509, Pergamon, New York, 1977). For Mercury and the Moon, temperatures in shadows in polar craters are below 102 K, so the sublimation rate of water ice calculated according to the model of Watson et al. (J. Geophys. Res. 66, 3033-3015 (1961)) is less than 1 cm per byr. The latitudinal extent of the cold zone on the Moon is greater than that on Mercury, although temperatures at the poles of the two planets are similar. The other application is to polar frosts on Mars. Illuminated water frosts in radiative equilibrium grow rougher, because the average temperature of a depression is greater than that of flat ground. Subliming CO2 frosts, which are always at the same temperature, grow rougher at low solar elevation angles because the heat flux absorbed by a depression is greater than that for a flat surface. At high insolation rates (high Sun near perihelion) the average heat flux to a depression is less than for a flat surface. The latter evaporates faster, which makes the average surface smoother and leads to a high average albedo. This behavior helps explain the fact that the south CO2 cap, which receives its greatest insolation near perihelion, has a higher effective albedo and therefore can survive the summer, whereas the north CO2 cap has a lower effective albedo and disappears each year around summer solstice.},

  abstract = {Hycean worlds are a proposed subset of sub-Neptune exoplanets with substantial water inventories, liquid surface oceans, and extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres favorable for habitability. We aim to quantitatively define the inner edge of the Hycean habitable zone (HZ) using a 1D radiative-convective model. As a limiting case, we model a dry hydrogen--helium envelope above a surface ocean. For a 1 bar (10,100 bar) atmosphere, the hydrogen greenhouse effect alone sets the inner edge of the HZ at 0.216 au (0.58, 3.71 au) for a Sun-like G star and at 0.0364 au (0.110, 0.774 au) for an 3500 K M star. Introducing water vapor into the atmosphere, the runaway greenhouse instellation limit is greatly reduced due to the presence of superadiabatic layers where convection is inhibited. This moves the inner edge of the HZ from {$\approx$}1 au for a G star to 1.6 au (3.85 au) for a Hycean world with a H2--He inventory of 1 bar (10 bar). For an M star, the inner edge is equivalently moved from 0.17--0.28 au (0.54 au). Our results suggest that most of the current Hycean world observational targets are not likely to sustain a liquid water ocean. We present an analytical framework for interpreting our results, finding that the maximum possible outgoing longwave radiation scales approximately inversely with the dry mass inventory of the atmosphere. We discuss the possible limitations of our 1D modeling and recommend the use of 3D convection-resolving models to explore the robustness of superadiabatic layers.},

This can be detected from the ground using modest-aperture telescopes by targeting samples of nearby M dwarfs. Such planets would be very amenable to follow-up studies due to the brightness of the parent stars, and the favourable planet-star flux ratio. MEarth is such a transit survey of {\textasciitilde}2000 nearby M dwarfs. Since the targets are distributed over the entire (Northern) sky, it is necessary to observe them individually, which will be done by using 8 independent 0.4m robotic telescopes, two of which have been in operation since December 2007 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) located on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. We discuss the survey design and hardware, and report on the current status of the survey, and preliminary results obtained from the commissioning data.},

This radius valley separates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as "super-Earths" and "mini-Neptunes" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting model interprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, where super-Earths are rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. In this work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radius valley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planets migrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked in resonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities "break the chains" and promote late collisions. This model broadly matches the period-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, and accounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here, by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositional mass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-rich atmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accounts for the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity ("peas-in-a-pod") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets with sizes of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.4 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ are mostly rocky, whereas those with sizes of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.4 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ are mostly water-ice rich worlds. Our results do not support an exclusively rocky composition for the cores of mini-Neptunes.},

  abstract = {Active comets have been detected in several exoplanetary systems, although so far only indirectly, when the dust or gas in the extended coma has transited in front of the stellar disk. The large optical surface and relatively high temperature of an active cometary coma also makes it suitable to study with direct imaging, but the angular separation is generally too small to be reachable with present-day facilities. However, future imaging facilities with the ability to detect terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of nearby systems will also be sensitive to exocomets in such systems. Here we examine several aspects of exocomet imaging, particularly in the context of the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE), which is a proposed space mission for infrared imaging and spectroscopy through nulling interferometry. We study what capabilities LIFE would have for acquiring imaging and spectroscopy of exocomets, based on simulations of the LIFE performance as well as statistical properties of exocomets that have recently been deduced from transit surveys. We find that for systems with extreme cometary activities such as beta Pictoris, sufficiently bright comets may be so abundant that they overcrowd the LIFE inner field of view. More nearby and moderately active systems such as epsilon Eridani or Fomalhaut may turn out to be optimal targets. If the exocomets have strong silicate emission features, such as in comet Hale-Bopp, it may become possible to study the mineralogy of individual exocometary bodies. We also discuss the possibility of exocomets as false positives for planets, with recent deep imaging of alpha Centauri as one hypothetical example. Such contaminants could be common, primarily among young debris disk stars, but should be rare among the main sequence population. We discuss strategies to mitigate the risk of any such false positives.},

For each new observation, we determined its radial velocity and measured its H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} activity index and its rotation velocity. Additionally, we have multiple observations of many stars to investigate if there are any radial velocity variations due to multiplicity. The results of our survey confirm that early-M dwarfs are H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} inactive with low rotational velocities and that late-M dwarfs are H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} active with very high rotational velocities. The results of this high-resolution analysis comprise the most extensive catalogue of rotation and activity in M dwarfs currently available.}}}},

We treat the evidence ratio as a statistic and investigate its distribution over an ensemble of experiments, considering both simple analytical examples and some more realistic cases, which require numerical simulation. We find that the evidence ratio is a noisy statistic, and thus it may not be sensible to decide to accept or reject a model based solely on whether the evidence ratio reaches some threshold value. The odds suggested by the evidence ratio bear no obvious relationship to the power or Type I error rate of a test based on the evidence ratio. The general performance of such tests is strongly affected by the signal-to-noise ratio in the data, the assumed priors and the threshold in the evidence ratio that is taken as `decisive'. The comprehensiveness of the model suite under consideration is also very important. The usefulness of the evidence ratio approach in a given problem can be assessed in advance of the experiment, using simple models and numerical approximations. In many cases, this approach can be as informative as a much more costly full-scale Bayesian analysis of a complex problem.},

However, mysteries still remain, partly due to bias and uncertainty of the current observational data sets and partly due to the fact that theoretical models for the formation and evolution of planetary systems are still underdeveloped. In this study, we calculate the spin angular momentum of host stars and the orbital angular momentum of their planets using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive along with detailed analysis of observation dependent biases and uncertainty ranges. We also analyze the angular momentum of the planetary system as a function of star age to understand their variation in different evolutionary stages. In addition, we use a population of planets from theoretical model simulations to reexamine the observed patterns and compare the simulated population with the observed samples to assess variations and differences. We found the majority of exoplanets discovered thus far do not have the angular momentum distribution similar to that of planets in our solar system, though this could be due to the observation bias. When filtered by the observational biases, the model simulated angular momentum distributions are comparable to the observed pattern in general. However, the differences between the observation and model simulation in the parameter (angular momentum) space provide more rigorous constraints and insights on the issues that needed future improvement.},

We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the "evaporation valley" in the distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this "triangle of evaporation" in the distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the observed diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with increasing radius (R/R\_Earth{\textbackslash}textless1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; {\textbackslash}textgreater3: H/He). The mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes density and orbital distance to be anti-correlated for low-mass planets, in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission which will observe the temporal dimension.},

Chondrules inside primitive meteorites---formed by melting of dust aggregate pebbles or in impacts between planetesimals---have similar sizes.

The masses and orbits of Venus, Earth, Theia (which later collided with Earth to form the Moon), and Mars are all consistent with pebble accretion onto protoplanets that formed around Mars' orbit and migrated to their final positions while growing. The isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are matched qualitatively by accretion of two generations of pebbles, carrying distinct isotopic signatures. Last, we show that the water and carbon budget of Earth can be delivered by pebbles from the early generation before the gas envelope became hot enough to vaporize volatiles.},

  abstract = {The pathway to forming the iron-rich planet Mercury remains mysterious. Mercury's core makes up 70\% of the planetary mass, which implies a significant enrichment of iron relative to silicates, while its mantle is strongly depleted in oxidized iron. The high core mass fraction is traditionally ascribed to evaporative loss of silicates, e.g. following a giant impact, but the high abundance of moderately volatile elements in the mantle of Mercury is inconsistent with reaching temperatures much above 1,000 K during its formation. Here we explore the nucleation of solid particles from a gas of solar composition that cools down in the hot inner regions of the protoplanetary disc. The high surface tension of iron causes iron particles to nucleate homogeneously (i.e., not on a more refractory substrate) under very high supersaturation. The low nucleation rates lead to depositional growth of large iron pebbles on a sparse population of nucleated iron nano-particles. Silicates in the form of iron-free MgSiO\$\_3\$ nucleate at similar temperatures but obtain smaller sizes due to the much higher number of nucleated particles. This results in a chemical separation of large iron particles from silicate particles with ten times lower Stokes numbers. We propose that such conditions lead to the formation of iron-rich planetesimals by the streaming instability. In this view, Mercury formed by accretion of iron-rich planetesimals with a sub-solar abundance of highly reduced silicate material. Our results imply that the iron-rich planets known to orbit the Sun and other stars are not required to have experienced mantle-stripping impacts. Instead their formation could be a direct consequence of temperature fluctuations in protoplanetary discs and chemical separation of distinct crystal species through the ensuing nucleation process.},

We combine spectroscopic constraints, presented in Paper I, with stellar interior modeling to estimate stellar masses, radii, and ages. Stellar radii are typically constrained to 11\%, compared to 40\% when only photometric constraints are used. Stellar masses are constrained to 4\%, and ages are constrained to 30\%. We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42\% to 12\%. We also leverage improved knowledge of stellar effective temperature to recompute incident stellar fluxes for the planets, now precise to 21\%, compared to a factor of two when derived from photometry.},

  abstract = {The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will perform a Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to discover bound exoplanets with semimajor axes greater than 1 au using gravitational microlensing. Roman will even be sensitive to planetary-mass objects that are not gravitationally bound to any host star. Such free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) will be detected as isolated microlensing events with timescales shorter than a few days. A measurement of the abundance and mass function of FFPs is a powerful diagnostic of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as the physics of the formation of isolated objects via direct collapse. We show that Roman will be sensitive to FFP lenses that have masses from that of Mars (0.1 M{$\oplus$}) to gas giants (M {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 M{$\oplus$}) as isolated lensing events with timescales from a few hours to several tens of days, respectively. We investigate the impact of the detection criteria on the survey, especially in the presence of finite-source effects for low-mass lenses. The number of detections will depend on the abundance of such FFPs as a function of mass, which is at present poorly constrained. Assuming that FFPs follow the fiducial mass function of cold, bound planets adapted from Cassan et al., we estimate that Roman will detect {$\sim$}250 FFPs with masses down to that of Mars (including {$\sim$}60 with masses {$\leq$} M{$\oplus$}). We also predict that Roman will improve the upper limits on FFP populations by at least an order of magnitude compared to currently existing constraints.},

In this paper, I study the chemical, thermal, and hydrodynamic processes in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets, concentrating on water-vapor-dominated atmospheres orbiting in the habitable zones of active stars. I consider different stellar activity levels and find very high levels of atmospheric escape in all cases, with the outflowing gas being dominated by atomic hydrogen and oxygen in both their neutral and ion forms. In the lower activity cases, I find that the accumulation of O2 and increases in the D/H ratios in the atmospheres due to mass fractionation are possible, but in the higher activity cases, no mass fractionation takes place. Connecting these results to stellar activity evolution tracks for solar-mass stars, I show that huge amounts of water vapor can be lost, and both the losses and the amount of O2 that can be accumulated in the atmosphere depend sensitively on the star's initial rotation rate. For an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of a low-mass M dwarf, my results suggest that the accumulation of atmospheric O2 is unlikely unless water loss can take place after the star's most active phase.},

We find HD 187085 has a Jupiter-mass companion with a {$\sim$}1000-d orbit. Our formal `best-fitting' solution suggests an eccentricity of 0.47, however, it does not sample the periastron passage of the companion and we find that orbital solutions with eccentricities between 0.1 and 0.8 give only slightly poorer fits (based on rms and {$\chi$}2{$\nu$}) and are thus plausible. Observations made during periastron passage in 2007 June should allow for the reliable determination of the orbital eccentricity for the companion to HD 187085. Our data set for HD 20782 does sample periastron and so the orbit for its companion can be more reliably determined. We find the companion to HD 20782 has M sin {$\quad$}i= 1.77 {\textpm} 0.22{$\quad$}MJup, an orbital period of 595.86 {\textpm} 0.03{$\quad$}d and an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.92 {\textpm} 0.03. The detection of such high-eccentricity (and relatively low-velocity amplitude) exoplanets appears to be facilitated by the long-term precision of the Anglo-Australian Planet Search. Looking at exoplanet detections as a whole, we find that those with higher eccentricity seem to have relatively higher velocity amplitudes indicating higher mass planets and/or an observational bias against the detection of high-eccentricity systems.},

  abstract = {The relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars compared with solar-type stars is a key prediction from the core-accretion planet formation theory. In this paper we report on the discovery of four gas giant planets that transit low-mass late K and early M dwarfs. The planets HATS-74Ab (TOI 737b), HATS-75b (TOI 552b), HATS-76b (TOI 555b), and HATS-77b (TOI 730b) were all discovered from the HATSouth photometric survey and follow-up using TESS and other photometric facilities. We use the new ESPRESSO facility at the VLT to confirm systems and measure their masses. We find that these planets have masses of 1.46 {\textpm} 0.14 MJ, 0.491 {\textpm} 0.039 MJ, 2.629 {\textpm} 0.089 MJ, and MJ, respectively, and radii of 1.032 {\textpm} 0.021 RJ, 0.884 {\textpm} 0.013 RJ, 1.079 {\textpm} 0.031 RJ, and 1.165 {\textpm} 0.021 RJ, respectively. The planets all orbit close to their host stars with orbital periods ranging from 1.7319 days to 3.0876 days. With further work, we aim to test core-accretion theory by using these and further discoveries to quantify the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass host stars.},

  abstract = {Life in the clouds of Venus, if present in sufficiently high abundance, must be affecting the atmospheric chemistry. It has been proposed that abundant Venusian life could obtain energy from its environment using three possible sulfur energy-metabolisms. These metabolisms raise the possibility of Venus's enigmatic cloud-layer SO2-depletion being caused by life. We here couple each proposed energy-metabolism to a photochemical-kinetics code and self-consistently predict the composition of Venus's atmosphere under the scenario that life produces the observed SO2-depletion. Using this photo-bio-chemical kinetics code, we show that all three metabolisms can produce SO2-depletions, but do so by violating other observational constraints on Venus's atmospheric chemistry. We calculate the maximum possible biomass density of sulfur-metabolising life in the clouds, before violating observational constraints, to be {\textasciitilde}10-5\,-\,10-3\,mg\,m-3. The methods employed are equally applicable to aerial biospheres on Venus-like exoplanets, planets that are optimally poised for atmospheric characterisation in the near future.},

We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future.},

These sources are: geochemical energy, sunlight, oxygen, flesh and fire. The first two were present at the start, but oxygen, flesh and fire are all consequences of evolutionary events. Since no category of energy source has disappeared, this has, over time, resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a concomitant increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. These energy expansions have also mediated the transformation of key aspects of the planetary environment, which have in turn mediated the future course of evolutionary change. Using energy as a lens thus illuminates patterns in the entwined histories of life and Earth, and may also provide a framework for considering the potential trajectories of life--planet systems elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called "metallicity"), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m (26\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m that is not reproduced by these models.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of exoplanets with sizes similar to Neptune orbiting their host stars with periods \${\textbackslash}lesssim 3\$ days -- hence the name ``sub-Jovian/Neptune desert''. Recently, several exoplanets have been confirmed to reside in the desert transforming it into a ``savanna'' with several ``giraffe'' planets (such as LTT 9779 b and TOI-674 b). The most prominent scenarios put forward for the explanation of the formation of the desert are related to the stellar irradiation destroying the primary atmosphere of certain specific exoplanets. We aim to present three targets (LTT 9779 b, TOI-674 b and WASP-156 b) which, when observed at wide wavelength ranges in infrared (IR), could prove the presence of these processes, and therefore improve the theories of planetary formation/evolution. We simulate and analyse realistic light curves of the selected exoplanets with PLATO/NCAM and the three narrow-band filters of Ariel (VISPhot, FGS1 and FGS2) based on TESS observations of these targets. We improved the precision of the transit parameters of the three considered planets from the TESS data. We find that the combination of the three narrow-band filters of Ariel can yield inner precision of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 1.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the planetary radii. Data from the three telescopes together will span decades, allowing the monitoring of changes in the planetary atmosphere through radius measurements. The three selected ``giraffe'' planets can be golden targets for Ariel, whereby the loss of planetary mass due to stellar irradiation could be studied with high precision, multi-wavelength (spectro-)photometry.},

  abstract = {Venus and Earth provide astonishingly different views of the evolution of a rocky planet, raising the question of why these two rocky worlds evolved so differently. The recently discovered transiting Super-Earth LP 890-9c (TOI-4306c, SPECULOOS-2c) is a key to the question. It circles a nearby M6V star in 8.46 d. LP890-9c receives similar flux as modern Earth, which puts it very close to the inner edge of the Habitable Zone (HZ), where models differ strongly in their prediction of how long rocky planets can hold onto their water. We model the atmosphere of a hot LP890-9c at the inner edge of the HZ, where the planet could sustain several very different environments. The resulting transmission spectra differ considerably between a hot, wet exo-Earth, a steamy planet caught in a runaway greenhouse, and an exo-Venus. Distinguishing these scenarios from the planet's spectra will provide critical new insights into the evolution of hot terrestrial planets into exo-Venus. Our model and spectra are available online as a tool to plan observations. They show that observing LP890-9c can provide key insights into the evolution of a rocky planet at the inner edge of the HZ as well as the long-term future of Earth.},

Assuming thermal equilibrium and blackbody emission, together with the limiting spatial resolution and sensitivity of our simulated instrument in the three specific bands 5.6, 10.0, and 15.0 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m, we quantified the number of detectable exoplanets as a function of their radii and equilibrium temperatures.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}Approximately 315\textsubscript{-77{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+113{$<$}sup/{$>$} exoplanets, with radii 0.5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Earth{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\leq$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\leq$} 6 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Earth{$<$}sub/{$>$}, were detected in at least one band and half were detected in all three bands during {\textasciitilde}0.52 years of mission time assuming throughputs 3.5 times worse than those for the \emph{James Webb {$<$}i/{$>$}Space Telescope and {\textasciitilde}40\% overheads. Accounting for stellar leakage and (unknown) exozodiacal light, the discovery phase of the mission very likely requires 2-3 years in total. The uncertainties in planet yield are dominated by uncertainties in the underlying planet population, but the distribution of the Bond albedos also has a significant impact. Roughly 50\% of the detected planets orbit M stars, which also have the highest planet yield per star; the other 50\% orbit FGK stars, which show a higher completeness in the detectability. Roughly 85 planets could be habitable (0.5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Earth{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\leq$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\leq$} 1.75 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Earth{$<$}sub/{$>$} and 200 K {$\leq$} \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eq{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\leq$} 450 K) and are prime targets for spectroscopic observations in a second mission phase.

Our yield estimates are based on recently derived rocky planet occurrence rates from the Kepler mission and our LIFE exoplanet observation simulation tool LIFEsim, which includes all major astrophysical noise sources, but no instrumental noise sources, yet. Depending on a pessimistic or optimistic extrapolation of the Kepler results, we find that during a 2.5-year search phase LIFE could detect between {\textasciitilde}10-16 (average) or {\textasciitilde}5-34 (including 1-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainties) rocky planets (0.5-1.5 R\$\{\}\_{\textbackslash}rm\{Earth\}\$) within the optimistic HZ of Sun-like stars and between {\textasciitilde}4-6 (average) or {\textasciitilde}1-13 (including 1-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainties) exo-Earth candidates (EECs) assuming four collector spacecraft equipped with 2 m mirrors and a conservative instrument throughput of 5\%. With D=3.5 m or 1 m mirrors, the yield \$Y\$ changes strongly following approximately \$Y {\textbackslash}propto D{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}\$. With the larger sample of FGK-type stars, the yield increases to {\textasciitilde}16-22 (average) rocky planets within the optimistic HZ and {\textasciitilde}5-8 (average) EECs. Furthermore, we find that, besides the mirror diameter, the yield depends strongly on the total throughput, but only weakly on the exozodiacal dust level and the accessible wavelength range of the mission. When focusing entirely on Sun-like stars, larger mirrors ({\textasciitilde}3 m with 5\% total throughput) or a better total throughput ({\textasciitilde}20\% with 2 m mirrors) are required to detect a statistically relevant sample of {\textasciitilde}30 rocky planets within the optimistic HZ.},

Such discoveries have been a key feature of results from the Kepler mission which utilizes the transit method to determine the size of the planet. These discoveries have resulted in a corresponding interest in the topic of the Habitable Zone and the search for potential Earth analogs. Within the solar system, there is a clear dichotomy between Venus and Earth in terms of atmospheric evolution, likely the result of the large difference (approximately a factor of two) in incident flux from the Sun. Since Venus is 95\% of the Earth's radius in size, it is impossible to distinguish between these two planets based only on size. In this Letter we discuss planetary insolation in the context of atmospheric erosion and runaway greenhouse limits for planets similar to Venus. We define a ``Venus Zone'' in which the planet is more likely to be a Venus analog rather than an Earth analog. We identify 43 potential Venus analogs with an occurrence rate ({$\eta$}{\venus}) of and for M dwarfs and GK dwarfs, respectively.},

A fundamental aspect of understanding the limits of habitable environments (surface liquid water) and detectable signatures thereof is the study of where the boundaries of such environments can occur. Such studies provide the basis for understanding how a once inhabitable planet might come to be uninhabitable. The archetype of such a planet is arguably Earth's sibling planet, Venus. Given the need to define the conditions that can rule out bio-related signatures of exoplanets, Venus provides a unique opportunity to explore the processes that led to a completely uninhabitable environment by our current definition of the term. Here we review the current state of knowledge regarding Venus, particularly in the context of remote-sensing techniques that are being or will be employed in the search for and characterization of exoplanets. We discuss candidate Venus analogs identified by the Kepler and TESS exoplanet missions and provide an update to exoplanet demographics that can be placed in the potential runaway greenhouse regime where Venus analogs are thought to reside. We list several major outstanding questions regarding the Venus environment and the relevance of those questions to understanding the atmospheres and interior structure of exoplanets.

The few substantial terrestrial planetary atmospheres within the Solar System serve as a critical resource in studying these habitability factors, from which models can be constructed for application to extrasolar planets. The recent Astronomy and Astrophysics and Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Surveys both emphasise the need for an improved understanding of planetary habitability as an essential goal within the context of astrobiology. The divergence in climate evolution of Venus and Earth provides a major, accessible basis for understanding how the habitability of large rocky worlds evolves with time and what conditions limit the boundaries of habitability. Here, we argue that Venus can be considered an "anchor point" for understanding planetary habitability within the context of terrestrial planet evolution. We discuss the major factors that have influenced the respective evolutionary pathways of Venus and Earth, how these factors might be weighted in their overall influence, and the measurements that will shed further light on their impacts of these worlds' histories. We further discuss the importance of Venus with respect to both of the recent decadal surveys, and how these community consensus reports can help shape the exploration of Venus in the coming decades.},

  abstract = {Fundamental to our understanding of planetary bulk compositions is the relationship between their masses and radii, two properties that are often not simultaneously known for most exoplanets. However, while many previous studies have modeled the two-dimensional relationship between planetary mass and radii, this approach largely ignores the dependencies on other properties that may have influenced the formation and evolution of the planets. In this work, we extend the existing nonparametric and probabilistic framework of {\textbackslash}texttt\{MRExo\} to jointly model distributions beyond two dimensions. Our updated framework can now simultaneously model up to four observables, while also incorporating asymmetric measurement uncertainties and upper limits in the data. We showcase the potential of this multi-dimensional approach to three science cases: (i) a 4-dimensional joint fit to planetary mass, radius, insolation, and stellar mass, hinting of changes in planetary bulk density across insolation and stellar mass; (ii) a 3-dimensional fit to the California Kepler Survey sample showing how the planet radius valley evolves across different stellar masses; and (iii) a 2-dimensional fit to a sample of Class-II protoplanetary disks in Lupus while incorporating the upper-limits in dust mass measurements. In addition, we employ bootstrap and Monte-Carlo sampling to quantify the impact of the finite sample size as well as measurement uncertainties on the predicted quantities. We update our existing open-source user-friendly {\textbackslash}texttt\{MRExo\} {\textbackslash}texttt\{Python\} package with these changes, which allows users to apply this highly flexible framework to a variety of datasets beyond what we have shown here.},

TOI-5205b has one of the highest mass ratios for M-dwarf planets, with a mass ratio of almost 0.3\%, as it orbits a host star that is just 0.392 {\textpm} 0.015 M {$\odot$}. Its planetary radius is 1.03 {\textpm} 0.03 R J, while the mass is 1.08 {\textpm} 0.06 M J. Additionally, the large size of the planet orbiting a small star results in a transit depth of {$\sim$}7\%, making it one of the deepest transits of a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star. The large transit depth makes TOI-5205b a compelling target to probe its atmospheric properties, as a means of tracing the potential formation pathways. While there have been radial-velocity-only discoveries of giant planets around mid-M dwarfs, this is the first transiting Jupiter with a mass measurement discovered around such a low-mass host star. The high mass of TOI-5205b stretches conventional theories of planet formation and disk scaling relations that cannot easily recreate the conditions required to form such planets.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ({$\greaterequivlnt$}8R{$\oplus$}) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ({$\greaterequivlnt$}2 MJ) around M dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher-mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors, such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of vsini-related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published nondetections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional photochemical-dynamic model is used to study hydrodynamic loss of hydrogen from a primitive, water-rich atmosphere on Venus. The escape flux is calculated as a function of the H2O mixing ratio at the atmospheric cold trap. The cold-trap mixing ratio is then related in an approximate fashion to the H2O concentration in the lower atmosphere. Hydrodynamic escape should have been the dominant loss process for hydrogen when the H2O mass mixing ratio in the lower atmosphere exceeded {$\sim$}0.1. The escape rate would have depended upon the magnitude of the solar ultraviolet flux and the atmospheric euv heating efficiency and, to a lesser extent, on the O2 content of the atmosphere. The time required for Venus to have lost the bulk of a terrestrial ocean of water is on the order of a billion years. Deutrium would have been swept away along with hydrogen if the escape rate was high enough, but some D/H enrichment should have occurred as the escape rate slowed down.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to study the response of an Earth-like atmosphere to large increases in solar flux. For fully saturated, cloud-free conditions, the critical solar flux at which a runaway greenhouse occurs, that is, the oceans evaporate entirely, is found to be 1.4 times the present flux at Earth's orbit (S0). This value is close to the flux expected at Venus' orbit early in solar system history. It is nearly independent of the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere, but is sensitive to the H2O absorption coefficient in the 8- to 12-{$\mu$}m window region. Clouds should tend to depress the surface temperature on a warm, moist planet; thus, Venus may originally have had oceans if its initial water endowment was close to that of Earth. It lost them early in its history, however, because of rapid photodissociation of water vapor followed by escape of hydrogen to space. The critical solar flux above which water is rapidly lost could be as low as 1.1S0. The surface temperature of a runaway greenhouse atmosphere containing a full ocean's worth of water would have been in excess of 1500{$^\circ$}K---above the solidus for silicate rocks. The presence of such a steam atmosphere during accretion may have significantly influenced the early thermal evolution of both Earth and Venus.},

Condensation of CO2 decreases the lapse rate and, hence, reduces the magnitude of the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon becomes increasingly important at low solar luminosities and may preclude warm (0{$^\circ$}C), globally averaged surface temperatures prior to {$\sim$}2 billion years ago unless other greenhouse gases were present in addition to CO2 and H2O.

  abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

Addressing this question requires improved modeling of water-rich exoplanetary atmospheres, both to predict and interpret spectroscopic observations and to serve as upper boundary conditions on interior structure calculations. Here we present new models of hydrogen-helium-water atmospheres with water abundances ranging from solar to 100\% water vapor. We improve upon previous models of high water content atmospheres by incorporating updated prescriptions for water self-broadening and a non-ideal gas equation of state. Our model grid (https://umd.box.com/v/water-worlds) includes temperature-pressure profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium, along with their associated transmission and thermal emission spectra. We find that our model updates primarily act at high pressures, significantly impacting bottom-of-atmosphere temperatures, with implications for the accuracy of interior structure calculations. Upper atmosphere conditions and spectroscopic observables are less impacted by our model updates, and we find that under most conditions, retrieval codes built for hot Jupiters should also perform well on water-rich planets. We additionally quantify the observational degeneracies among both thermal emission and transmission spectra. We recover standard degeneracies with clouds and mean molecular weight for transmission spectra, and we find thermal emission spectra to be more readily distinguishable from one another in the water-poor (i.e. near-solar) regime.},

Stars more massive than 3 M{$\Sun$} evolve quickly to the main sequence, which pushes the snow line to 10-15 AU before protoplanets form and limits the range of disk masses that form giant planet cores.

This result is largely insensitive to our assumed model parameters.

Monitoring programmes with the warm Spitzer mission have recorded substantial and rapid changes in mid-infrared output for several stars, interpreted as variations in the surface area of warm, dusty material ejected by planetary-scale collisions and heated by the central star: for example, NGC 2354--ID8 (refs.\,4,5), HD 166191 (ref.\,6) and V488 Persei7. Here we report combined observations of the young (about 300\,million years old), solar-like star ASASSN-21qj: an infrared brightening consistent with a blackbody temperature of 1,000\,Kelvin and a luminosity~that is 4~percent that of the star lasting for about 1,000\,days, partially overlapping in time with a complex and deep, wavelength-dependent optical eclipse that lasted for about 500\,days. The optical eclipse started 2.5\,years after the infrared brightening, implying an orbital period of at least that duration. These observations are consistent with a collision between two exoplanets of several to tens of Earth masses at 2--16\,astronomical units from the central star. Such an impact produces a hot, highly extended post-impact remnant with sufficient luminosity to explain the infrared observations. Transit of the impact debris, sheared by orbital motion into a long cloud, causes the subsequent complex eclipse of the host star.},

  abstract = {In the core accretion scenario of planet formation, rocky cores grow by first accreting solids until they are massive enough to accrete gas. For giant planet formation this means that a massive core must form within the lifetime of the gas disk. The accretion of roughly km-sized planetesimals and the accretion of mm-cm sized pebbles are typically discussed separately as the main solid accretion mechanisms. We investigate the interplay between the two accretion processes in a disk containing both pebbles and planetesimals for planet formation in general and in the context of giant planet formation specifically. The goal is to disentangle and understand the fundamental interactions that arise in such hybrid pebble-planetesimal models. We combine a simple model of pebble formation and accretion with a global model of planet formation which considers the accretion of planetesimals. We compare synthetic populations of planets formed in disks composed of different amounts of pebbles and 600 meter sized planetesimals. On a system-level, we study the formation pathway of giant planets in these disks. We find that, in hybrid disks containing both pebbles and planetesimals, the formation of giant planets is strongly suppressed whereas in a pebbles-only or planetesimals-only scenario, giant planets can form. We identify the heating associated with the accretion of up to 100 km sized planetesimals after the pebble accretion period to delay the runaway gas accretion of massive cores. Coupled with strong inward type-I migration acting on these planets, this results in close-in icy sub-Neptunes originating from the outer disk. We conclude that, in hybrid pebble-planetesimal scenarios, the late accretion of planetesimals is a critical factor in the giant planet formation process and that inward migration is more efficient for planets in increasingly pebble dominated disks.},

The Exoplanet Biosignatures Workshop Without Walls (EBWWW) held in 2016 engaged the international scientific community across diverse scientific disciplines, to assess the state of the science and technology in the search for life on exoplanets, and to identify paths for progress. The workshop activities resulted in five major review papers, which provide (1) an encyclopedic review of known and proposed biosignatures and models used to ascertain them (Schwieterman et al.,2018 in this issue); (2) an in-depth review of O2 as a biosignature, rigorously examining the nuances of false positives and false negatives for evidence of life (Meadows et al.,2018 in this issue); (3) a Bayesian framework to comprehensively organize current understanding to quantify confidence in biosignature assessments (Catling et al.,2018 in this issue); (4) an extension of that Bayesian framework in anticipation of increasing planetary data and novel concepts of biosignatures (Walker et al.,2018 in this issue); and (5) a review of the upcoming telescope capabilities to characterize exoplanets and their environment (Fujii et al.,2018 in this issue). Because of the immense content of these review papers, this summary provides a guide to their complementary scope and highlights salient features. Strong themes that emerged from the workshop were that biosignatures must be interpreted in the context of their environment, and that frameworks must be developed to link diverse forms of scientific understanding of that context to quantify the likelihood that a biosignature has been observed. Models are needed to explore the parameter space where measurements will be widespread but sparse in detail. Given the technological prospects for large ground-based telescopes and space-based observatories, the detection of atmospheric signatures of a few potentially habitable planets may come before 2030.

This design enables the rapid and efficient development of a large aperture telescope without segmented mirrors while maintaining a compact overall form factor. With its exceptional photon collection area and diffraction-limited resolving power, the TMA design is ideally suited for both the ground and space active/adaptive optics concepts, which require the capture of natural guide stars within the field of view for wavefront measurement to correct for misalignments and shape deformation caused by thermal gradients. The wide field of view requirement is based on a statistical analysis of bright natural guide stars available during observation. The primary mirror clear aperture, compactness requirement, and detector pixel sizes led to the choice of TMA over simpler two-mirror solutions like Ritchey-Chretien (RC) telescopes, and the TMA design offers superior diffraction-limited performance across the entire field of view. The standard conic surfaces applied to all three mirrors (M1, M2, and M3) simplify the optical fabrication, testing, and alignment process. Additionally, the TMA design is more tolerant than RC telescopes. Stray light control is critical for UV science instrumentation, and the field stop and Lyot stop are conveniently located in the TMA design for this purpose.},

So far, the theory of planetary migration has focused on the interaction of one or more planets with an inviscid or viscously evolving gaseous disk. Turbulent viscosity is thought to be the main driver of the secular evolution of the disk, and it is known to affect the migration process for intermediate- to high-mass planets. Recently, however, the topic of wind-driven accretion has experienced a renaissance because evidence is mounting that protoplanetary disks may be less turbulent than previously thought, and 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the wind-launching process is maturing.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We investigate how wind-driven accretion may affect planetary migration. We aim for a qualitative exploration of the main effects and not for a quantitative prediction.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We performed 2D hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with the FARGO3D code in the (\emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{{$\phi<$}i/{$>$}) plane. The vertical coordinate in the disk and the launching of the wind are not treated explicitly. Instead, the torque caused by the wind onto the disk is treated using a simple two-parameter formula. The parameters are the wind mass-loss rate and the lever arm.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the wind-driven accretion process replenishes the co-orbital region in a different way than the viscous accretion process. The former always injects mass from the outer edge of the co-orbital region, and always removes mass from the inner edge, while the latter injects or removes mass from the co-orbital region depending on the radial density gradients in the disk. As a consequence, the migration behavior can differ strongly, and can under certain conditions drive rapid type-III-like outward migration. We derive an analytic expression for the parameters under which this outward migration occurs.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} If wind-driven accretion plays a role in the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks, planetary migration studies have to include this process as well because it can strongly affect the resulting migration rate and migration direction.}}}}}}}},

It is expected that some of those planets are rocky planets with the potential for temperate climates favourable to surface liquid water. However, various models predict that terrestrial planets orbiting in the classical habitable zone around M dwarfs have no water or too much water, suggesting that habitable planets around M dwarfs might be rare. Here we present the results of an updated planetary population synthesis model, which includes the effects of water enrichment in the primordial atmosphere, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen by rocky materials from incoming planetesimals and from the magma ocean. We find that this water production in the primordial atmosphere is found to significantly impact the occurrence of terrestrial rocky aqua planets, yielding ones with diverse water content. We estimate that 5--10\% of the planets with a size of {$<$}1.3R{$\oplus$} orbiting early-to-mid M dwarfs have appropriate amounts of seawater for habitability. Such an occurrence rate would be high enough to detect potentially habitable planets by ongoing and near-future M-dwarf planet survey missions.},

We introduce our new algorithm, luna, which produces transit light curves for both bodies, analytically accounting for shadow overlaps, stellar limb darkening and planet--moon dynamical motion. By building the dynamics into the core of luna, the routine automatically accounts for transit-timing/duration variations and ingress/egress asymmetries for not only the planet, but also the moon.We then generate some artificial data for two feasibly detectable hypothetical systems of interest: (i) prograde and (ii) retrograde Earth-like moons around a habitable-zone Neptune for an M dwarf system. We fit the hypothetical systems using luna and demonstrate the feasibility of detecting these cases with Kepler photometry.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867\$\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.044\}\_\{- 0.044\}\}\$ and b = 3.03\$\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.17\}\_\{- 0.16\}\}\$. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7~times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6{$\sigma$} and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

  abstract = {Planets on eccentric orbits have a higher geometric probability of transiting their host star. By application of Bayes' theorem, we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased. Adopting the flexible Beta distribution as the underlying prior for eccentricity, we derive the marginalized transit probability as well as the a priori joint probability distribution of eccentricity and argument of periastron, given that a planet is known to transit. These results allow us to demonstrate that most planet occurrence rate calculations using Kepler data have overestimated the prevalence of planets by~{$\sim$}10 per cent. Indeed, the true occurrence of planets from transit surveys is fundamentally intractable without a prior assumption for the eccentricity distribution. Further more, we show that previously extracted eccentricity distributions using Kepler data are positively biased. In cases where one wishes to impose an informative eccentricity prior, we provide a recursive algorithm to apply inverse transform sampling of our joint prior probability distribution. Computer code of this algorithm, ECCSAMPLES, is provided to enable the community to sample directly from the prior (availablehere).},

Anticorrelated TTVs are clearly evident indicating that the transiters orbit the same star and interact via a near 2:1 mean motion resonance. By fitting the TTVs with a dynamical model, we infer masses of \$30\_\{-14\}{\textasciicircum}\{+20\}\$ and \$200\_\{-100\}{\textasciicircum}\{+170\}\$\,M{$\oplus$}, establishing that the objects are planetary in nature and have likely sub-Kronian and Kronian densities. TOI-216 lies close to the southern ecliptic pole and thus will be observed by TESS throughout the first year, providing an opportunity for continuous dynamical monitoring and considerable refinement of the dynamical masses presented here. TOI-216 closely resembles Kepler-9 in architecture, and we hypothesize that in such systems these Saturn analogues failed to fully open a gap and thus migrated far deeper into the system before becoming trapped into resonance, which would imply that future detections of new analogues may also have sub-Jupiter masses.},

  abstract = {Most stars in the Universe are red dwarfs. They outnumber stars like our Sun by a factor of 5 and outlive them by another factor of 20 (population-weighted mean). When combined with recent observations uncovering an abundance of temperate, rocky planets around these diminutive stars, we are faced with an apparent logical contradiction---Why do we not see a red dwarf in our sky? To address this ``red sky paradox,'' we formulate a Bayesian probability function concerning the odds of finding oneself around an F/G/K-spectral type (Sun-like) star. If the development of intelligent life from prebiotic chemistry is a universally rapid and ensured process, the temporal advantage of red dwarfs dissolves, softening the red sky paradox, but exacerbating the classic Fermi paradox. Otherwise, we find that humanity appears to be a 1-in-100 outlier. While this could be random chance (resolution I), we outline three other nonmutually exclusive resolutions (II to IV) that broadly act as filters to attenuate the suitability of red dwarfs for complex life. Future observations may be able to provide support for some of these. Notably, if surveys reveal a paucity of temperate rocky planets around the smallest (and most numerous) red dwarfs, then this would support resolution II. As another example, if future characterization efforts were to find that red dwarf worlds have limited windows for complex life due to stellar evolution, this would support resolution III. Solving this paradox would reveal guidance for the targeting of future remote life sensing experiments and the limits of life in the cosmos.},

  abstract = {One of the simplest ways to identify an exoplanetary transit is to phase fold a photometric time series upon a trial period -- leading to a coherent stack when using the correct value. Such phase-folded transits have become a standard data visualization in modern transit discovery papers. There is no analogous folding mechanism for exomoons, which would have to represent some kind of double fold: once for the planet and then another for the moon. Folding with the planet term only, a moon imparts a small decrease in the surrounding out-of-transit averaged intensity, but its incoherent nature makes it far less convincing than the crisp stacks familiar to exoplanet hunters. Here, a new approach is introduced that can be used to achieve the transit origami needed to double fold an exomoon, in the case where a planet exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs). This double fold has just one unknown parameter, the satellite-to-planet mass ratio, and thus a simple one-dimensional grid search can be used to rapidly identify power associated with candidate exomoons. The technique is demonstrated on simulated light curves, exploring the breakdown limits of close-in and/or inclined satellites. As an example, the method is deployed on Kepler-973b, a warm mini-Neptune exhibiting an 8-min TTV, where the possibility that the TTVs are caused by a single exomoon is broadly excluded, with upper limits probing down to a Ganymede-sized moon.},

  abstract = {The famous `Wow' signal detected in 1977 remains arguably the most compelling SETI signal ever found. The original Big Ear data require that the signal turned on/off over the span of {$\sim$}3\,min (time difference between the dual antennae), yet persisted for 72\,s (duration of a single beam sweep). Combined with the substantial and negative follow-up efforts, these observations limit the allowed range of signal repeat schedules, to the extent that one might question the credibility of the signal itself. Previous work has largely excluded the hypothesis of a strictly periodic repeating source, for periods shorter than 40\,h. However, a non-periodic, stochastic repeater remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ a likelihood emulator using the Big Ear observing logs to infer the probable signal properties under this hypothesis. We find that the maximum a-posteriori solution has a likelihood of 32.3~per\,cent, highly compatible with the Big Ear data, with a broad 2{$\sigma$} credible interval of signal duration 72\,s\&lt;T \&lt; 77\,min and mean repeat rate 0.043\,d-1 \&lt; {$\lambda$} \&lt; 59.8\,d-1. We extend our analysis to include 192\,h of subsequent observations from META, Hobart, and ATA, which drops the peak likelihood to 1.78~per\,cent, and thus in tension with the available data at the 2.4{$\sigma$} level. Accordingly, the Wow signal cannot be excluded as a stochastic repeater with available data, and we estimate that 62\,d of accumulated additional observations would be necessary to surpass 3{$\sigma$} confidence.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantification of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a given observational phenomenon is central to associated calculations of sensitivity, yield, completeness, and occurrence rate. Within the field of exoplanets, the SNR of a transit has been widely assumed to be the formula that one would obtain by assuming a boxcar light curve, yielding an SNR of the form \$({\textbackslash}delta /{\textbackslash}sigma \_0) {\textbackslash}sqrt\{D\}\$. In this work, a general framework is outlined for calculating the SNR of any analytic function and it is applied to the specific case of a trapezoidal transit as a demonstration. By refining the approximation from boxcar to trapezoid, an improved SNR equation~is obtained that takes the form \$({\textbackslash}delta /{\textbackslash}sigma \_0) {\textbackslash}sqrt\{(T\_\{14\}+2T\_\{23\})/3\}\$. A solution is also derived for the case of a trapezoid convolved with a top-hat, corresponding to observations with finite integration time, where it is proved that SNR is a monotonically decreasing function of integration time. As a rule of thumb, integration times exceeding T14/3 lead to a 10~per~cent loss in SNR. This work establishes that the boxcar transit is approximate and it is argued that efforts to calculate accurate completeness maps or occurrence rate statistics should either use the refined expression, or even better numerically solve for the SNR of a more physically complete transit model.},

  abstract = {Recently, Heller \& Hippke argued that the exomoon candidates Kepler-1625 b-i and Kepler-1708 b-i were allegedly 'refuted'. In this Matters Arising, we address these claims. For Kepler-1625 b, we show that their Hubble light curve is identical to that previously published by the same lead author, in which the moon-like dip was recovered. Indeed, our fits of their data again recover the moon-like dip with improved residuals than that obtained by Heller \& Hippke. Their fits therefore appear to have somehow missed this deeper likelihood maximum, as well producing apparently unconverged posteriors. Consequently, their best-fitting moon is the same radius as the planet, Kepler-1625 b; a radically different signal from that which was originally claimed. The authors then inject this solution into the Kepler data and remark, as a point of concern, how retrievals obtain much higher significances than originally reported. However, this issue stems from the injection of a fundamentally different signal. We demonstrate that their Hubble light curve exhibits {\textasciitilde}20\% higher noise and discards 11\% of the useful data, which compromises its ability to recover the subtle signal of Kepler-1625 b-i. For Kepler-1708 b-i it was claimed that the exomoon model's Bayes factor is highly sensitive to detrending choices, yielding reduced evidence with a biweight filter versus the original claim. We use their own i) detrended light curve and ii) biweight filter code to investigate these claims. For both, we recover the original moon signal, to even higher confidence than before. The discrepancy is explained by comparing to their quoted fit metrics, where we again demonstrate that the Heller \& Hippke regression definitively missed the deeper likelihood maximum corresponding to Kepler-1708 b-i. We conclude that both candidates remain viable but certainly demand further observations.},

  abstract = {In ecological systems, be it a garden or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. The growth curve is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.},

  abstract = {How and where did life on Earth originate? To date, various environments have been proposed as plausible sites for the origin of life. However, discussions have focused on a limited stage of chemical evolution, or emergence of a specific chemical function of proto-biological systems. It remains unclear what geochemical situations could drive all the stages of chemical evolution, ranging from condensation of simple inorganic compounds to the emergence of self-sustaining systems that were evolvable into modern biological ones. In this review, we summarize reported experimental and theoretical findings for prebiotic chemistry relevant to this topic, including availability of biologically essential elements (N and P) on the Hadean Earth, abiotic synthesis of life's building blocks (amino acids, peptides, ribose, nucleobases, fatty acids, nucleotides, and oligonucleotides), their polymerizations to bio-macromolecules (peptides and oligonucleotides), and emergence of biological functions of replication and compartmentalization. It is indicated from the overviews that completion of the chemical evolution requires at least eight reaction conditions of (1) reductive gas phase, (2) alkaline pH, (3) freezing temperature, (4) fresh water, (5) dry/dry-wet cycle, (6) coupling with high energy reactions, (7) heating-cooling cycle in water, and (8) extraterrestrial input of life's building blocks and reactive nutrients. The necessity of these mutually exclusive conditions clearly indicates that life's origin did not occur at a single setting; rather, it required highly diverse and dynamic environments that were connected with each other to allow intra-transportation of reaction products and reactants through fluid circulation. Future experimental research that mimics the conditions of the proposed model are expected to provide further constraints on the processes and mechanisms for the origin of life.},

For rocky exoplanets with 10--1000{\texttimes} Earth's H2O but without H2, we model the multi-Gyr evolution of ocean temperature and chemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and atmosphere--lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find that: (1) the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean chemistry; (2) possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3) surprisingly, many waterworlds retain habitable surface water for {$>$}1 Gyr, and (contrary to previous claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical cycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C exchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by seafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass and ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1\% of its history. In our model, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early water--rock interactions is---coincidentally---often within an order of magnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory overlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the ``sweet spot'' (0.2--20 bar) for which the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as wide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in the semimajor axis defines (for Sun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this effect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our findings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to our waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end calculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need for geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on waterworlds.},

  abstract = {The carbon footprint of astronomical research is an increasingly topical issue with first estimates of research institute and national community footprints having recently been published. As these assessments have typically excluded the contribution of astronomical research infrastructures, we complement these studies by providing an estimate of the contribution of astronomical space missions and ground-based observatories using greenhouse gas emission factors that relates cost and payload mass to carbon footprint. We find that worldwide active astronomical research infrastructures currently have a carbon footprint of 20.3\,{\textpm}\,3.3\,MtCO2 equivalent (CO2e) and an annual emission of 1,169\,{\textpm}\,249\,ktCO2e\,yr-1 corresponding to a footprint of 36.6\,{\textpm}\,14.0\,tCO2e\,per year\,per astronomer. Compared with contributions from other aspects of astronomy research activity, our results suggest that research infrastructures make the single largest contribution to the carbon footprint of an astronomer. We discuss the limitations and uncertainties of our method and explore measures that can bring greenhouse gas emissions from astronomical research infrastructures towards a sustainable level.},

Results from just 43 days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique, precise, extended, and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes, and eventually the results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars from red giants.},

  abstract = {Young terrestrial planets can capture or outgas hydrogen-rich atmospheres with tens to hundreds of bars of H2, which persist for 100 Myr or longer. Although the earliest habitable conditions on Earth and terrestrial exoplanets could thus arise while the atmosphere is still dominated by H2, the climatic effects of H2 remain poorly understood. Previous work showed that H2 induces strong greenhouse warming at the outer edge of the habitable zone. Here we use a 1D radiative--convective model to show that H2 also leads to strong warming near the inner edge of the habitable zone. Unlike H2's greenhouse warming at the outer edge, however, its effect near the inner edge is driven by thermodynamics: H2's large thermal scale height allows the atmosphere to store more water vapor than either a pure H2O atmosphere or an atmosphere with a heavy background gas, such as N2 or CO2, thereby amplifying the greenhouse effect of H2O. Using idealized gray calculations, we then present a general argument for how different background gases affect the inner edge of the habitable zone. H2 stands out for its ability to induce novel ``souffl{\'e}'' climates, which further support its warming effect. Our results show that if the earliest conditions on a planet near the inner edge of the habitable zone were H2-rich, they were likely also hot: 1 bar of H2 is sufficient to raise surface temperatures above 340 K, and 50 bar of H2 are sufficient to raise surface temperatures above 450 K.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Temperate terrestrial exoplanets are likely to be common objects, but their discovery and characterization is very challenging because of the small intrinsic signal compared to that of their host star. Various concepts for optimized space missions to overcome these challenges are currently being studied. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) initiative focuses on the development of a spacebased mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer probing the thermal emission of a large sample of exoplanets.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} This study derives the minimum requirements for the signal-to-noise ratio (\emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}), the spectral resolution (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}), and the wavelength coverage for the LIFE mission concept. Using an Earth-twin exoplanet as a reference case, we quantify how well planetary and atmospheric properties can be derived from its MIR thermal emission spectrum as a function of the wavelength range, \emph{S/N,{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We combined a cloud-free 1D atmospheric radiative transfer model, a noise model for observations with the LIFE interferometer, and the nested sampling algorithm for Bayesian parameter inference to retrieve planetary and atmospheric properties. We simulated observations of an Earth-twin exoplanet orbiting a G2V star at 10 pc from the Sun with different levels of exozodiacal dust emissions. We investigated a grid of wavelength ranges (3--20 {$\mu$}m, 4--18.5 {$\mu$}m, and 6--17 {$\mu$}m), \emph{S/Ns{$<$}i/{$>$} (5, 10, 15, and 20 determined at a wavelength of 11.2 {$\mu$}m), and \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}s (20, 35, 50, and 100).\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O, CO\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and O\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$} are detectable if \emph{S/N {$\geq<$}i/{$>$} 10 (uncertainty {$\leq$} {\textpm} 1.0 dex). We find upper limits for N\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O (abundance {$\lessequivlnt$}10\textsuperscript{-3{$<$}sup/{$>$}). In conrtrast, CO, N\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and O\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} are unconstrained. The lower limits for a CH\textsubscript{4{$<$}sub/{$>$} detection are \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} = 50 and \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} = 10. Our retrieval framework correctly determines the exoplanet's radius (uncertainty {$\leq$} {\textpm} 10\%), surface temperature (uncertainty {$\leq$} {\textpm} 20 K), and surface pressure (uncertainty {$\leq$} {\textpm} 0.5 dex) in all cloud-free retrieval analyses. Based on our current assumptions, the observation time required to reach the specified \emph{S/N{$<$}i/{$>$} for an Earth-twin at 10 pc when conservatively assuming a total instrument throughput of 5\% amounts to {$\approx$}6-7 weeks with four 2m apertures.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We provide first order estimates for the minimum technical requirements for LIFE via the retrieval study of an Earth-twin exoplanet. We conclude that a minimum wavelength coverage of 4--18.5 {$\mu$}m, an \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} of 50, and an \emph{S/N{$<$}i/{$>$} of at least 10 is required. With the current assumptions, the atmospheric characterization of several Earth-like exoplanets at a distance of 10 pc and within a reasonable amount of observing time will require apertures {$\geq$} 2m.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95--1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative--convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H2O and CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with Teff {$\lessequivlnt$} 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on {$\eta\oplus$}, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.},

  abstract = {The ongoing discoveries of extra-solar planets are unveiling a wide range of terrestrial mass (size) planets around their host stars. In this Letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K--7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 M{$\oplus$} and 5 M{$\oplus$}. Assuming H2O-(inner HZ) and CO2-(outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward ({$\sim$}10\% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward ({$\sim$}7\% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, three-dimensional climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step toward a more comprehensive analysis of HZs.},

  abstract = {Future NASA concept missions that are currently under study, like the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) and the Large Ultra-violet Optical Infra Red Surveyor, could discover a large diversity of exoplanets. We propose here a classification scheme that distinguishes exoplanets into different categories based on their size and incident stellar flux, for the purpose of providing the expected number of exoplanets observed (yield) with direct imaging missions. The boundaries of this classification can be computed using the known chemical behavior of gases and condensates at different pressures and temperatures in a planetary atmosphere. In this study, we initially focus on condensation curves for sphalerite ZnS, , , and . The order in which these species condense in a planetary atmosphere define the boundaries between different classes of planets. Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky planets (0.5--1.0 R{$\oplus$}), super-Earths (1.0--1.75 R{$\oplus$}), sub-Neptunes (1.75--3.5 R{$\oplus$}), sub-Jovians (3.5--6.0 R{$\oplus$}), and Jovians (6--14.3 R{$\oplus$}) based on their planet sizes, and ``hot,'' ``warm,'' and ``cold'' based on the incident stellar flux. We then calculate planet occurrence rates within these boundaries for different kinds of exoplanets, {$\eta$}planet, using the community coordinated results of NASA's Exoplanet Program Analysis Group's Science Analysis Group-13 (SAG-13). These occurrence rate estimates are in turn used to estimate the expected exoplanet yields for direct imaging missions of different telescope diameters.},

  abstract = {Gaia DR3 provides radial velocities for 33 million stars and spectroscopically derived atmospheric parameters for more than five million targets. When combined with the astrometric data, these allow us to derive orbital and stellar parameters that are key in order to understand the stellar populations of the Milky Way and perform galactic archaeology. We use the calibrated atmospheric parameters, 2MASS and Gaia-EDR3 photometry, and parallax-based distances to compute, via an isochrone fitting method, the ages, initial stellar masses and reddenings for the stars with spectroscopic parameters. We also derive the orbits (actions, eccentricities, apocentre, pericentre and Zmax) for all of the stars with measured radial velocities and astrometry, adopting two sets of line-of-sight distances from the literature and an axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy. Comparisons with reference catalogues of field and cluster stars suggest that reliable ages are obtained for stars younger than 9-10Gyr when the estimated relative age uncertainty is {$<$}50\%. For older stars, ages tend to be under-estimated. The most reliable stellar type for age determination are turn-off stars, even when the input atmospheric parameters have large uncertainties. Ages for giants and main-sequence stars are retrieved with uncertainties of {\textasciitilde}2Gyr when extinction towards the star's line-of sight is smaller than A\_V{$<$}2.5mag. The full catalogue is made publicly available to be downloaded. With it, the full chemo-dynamical properties of the extended Solar neighbourhood unfold, and allow us to better identify the properties of the spiral arms, to parameterise the dynamical heating of the disc, or to thoroughly study the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of an Earth-mass planet (\$M\_b{\textbackslash}sin i = 1.36{\textbackslash}pm0.21M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) on a 15.6d orbit of a relatively nearby (\$d{\textbackslash}sim\$9.6pc) and low-mass (\$0.167{\textbackslash}pm0.011 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) M5.0V star, Wolf 1069. Sitting at a separation of \$0.0672{\textbackslash}pm0.0014\$au away from the host star puts Wolf 1069b in the habitable zone (HZ), receiving an incident flux of \$S=0.652{\textbackslash}pm0.029S\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. The planetary signal was detected using telluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph, amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost four years. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which we attribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to our photometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergone with the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., from MEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of \$P\_\{rot\}=150-170\$d, with a likely value at \$169.3{\textasciicircum}\{+3.7\}\_\{-3.6\}\$d. The stellar activity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrate evidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possible factors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limits indicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbital periods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf 1069 b had a violent formation history. This planet is also the 6th closest Earth-mass planet situated in the conservative HZ, after Proxima Centauri b, GJ 1061d, Teegarden's Star c, and GJ 1002 b and c. Despite not transiting, Wolf 1069b is nonetheless a very promising target for future three-dimensional climate models to investigate various habitability cases as well as for sub-ms\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ RV campaigns to search for potential inner sub-Earth-mass planets in order to test planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {The abundance and distribution of solids inside the Hill sphere are central to our understanding of the giant planet dichotomy. Here, we present a 3D characterization of the dust density, mass flux, and mean opacities in the envelope of subthermal and superthermal-mass planets. We simulate the dynamics of multiple dust species in a global protoplanetary disk model accounting for dust feedback. We find that the meridional flows do not effectively stir dust grains at scales of the Bondi sphere. Thus the dust settling driven by the stellar gravitational potential sets the latitudinal dust density gradient within the planet envelope. Not only does the planet's potential enhance this gradient, but also the spiral wakes serve as another source of asymmetry. These asymmetries substantially alter the inferred mean Rosseland and Planck opacities. In cases with moderate-to-strong dust settling, the opacity gradient can range from a few percent to more than two orders of magnitude between the midplane and the polar regions of the Bondi sphere. Finally, we show that this strong latitudinal opacity gradient can introduce a transition between optically thick and thin regimes at the scales of the planet envelope. We suggest that this transition is likely to occur when the equilibrium scale height of hundred-micron-sized particles is smaller than the Hill radius of the forming planet. This work calls into question the adoption of a constant opacity derived from well-mixed distributions and demonstrates the need for global radiation hydrodynamics models of giant planet formation that account for dust dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent direct imaging discoveries suggest a new class of massive, distant planets around A stars. These widely separated giants have been interpreted as signs of planet formation driven by gravitational instability, but the viability of this mechanism is not clear-cut. In this paper, we first discuss the local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales. We then consider whether the fragment's subsequent growth can be terminated within the planetary mass regime. Finally, we place disks in the larger context of star formation and disk evolution models. We find that in order for gravitational instability to produce planets, disks must be atypically cold in order to reduce the initial fragment mass. In addition, fragmentation must occur during a narrow window of disk evolution, after infall has mostly ceased, but while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational instability. Under more typical conditions, disk-born objects will likely grow well above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit. We conclude that if planets are formed by gravitational instability, they must be the low-mass tail of the distribution of disk-born companions. To validate this theory, ongoing direct imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star companions to A stars. Their absence would suggest planet formation by a different mechanism such as core accretion, which is consistent with the debris disks detected in these systems. {\copyright} 2010.

  abstract = {We present a generalised estimator for the autocorrelation function, S-ACF, which is an extended version of the standard estimator of the autocorrelation function (ACF). S-ACF is a versatile definition that can robustly and efficiently extract periodicity and signal shape information from a time series, independent of the time sampling and with minimal assumptions about the underlying process. Calculating the autocorrelation of irregularly sampled time series becomes possible by generalising the lag of the standard estimator of the ACF to a real parameter and introducing the notion of selection and weight functions. We show that the S-ACF reduces to the standard ACF estimator for regularly sampled time series. Using a large number of synthetic time series we demonstrate that the performance of the S-ACF is as good or better than commonly used Gaussian and rectangular kernel estimators, and is comparable to a combination of interpolation and the standard estimator. We apply the S-ACF to astrophysical data by extracting rotation periods for the spotted star KIC 5110407, and compare our results to Gaussian process (GP) regression and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodograms. We find that the S-ACF periods typically agree better with those from GP regression than from LS periodograms, especially in cases where there is evolution in the signal shape. The S-ACF has a wide range of potential applications and should be useful in quantitative science disciplines where irregularly sampled time series occur. A Python implementation of the S-ACF is available under the MIT license.},

  abstract = {Chemical disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres has been proposed as a generalized method for detecting life on exoplanets through remote spectroscopy. Among solar system planets with substantial atmospheres, the modern Earth has the largest thermodynamic chemical disequilibrium due to the presence of life. However, how this disequilibrium changed over time and, in particular, the biogenic disequilibria maintained in the anoxic Archean or less oxic Proterozoic eons are unknown. We calculate the atmosphere-ocean disequilibrium in the Precambrian using conservative proxy- and model-based estimates of early atmospheric and oceanic compositions. We omit crustal solids because subsurface composition is not detectable on exoplanets, unlike above-surface volatiles. We find that (i) disequilibrium increased through time in step with the rise of oxygen; (ii) both the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic may have had remotely detectable biogenic disequilibria due to the coexistence of O2, N2, and liquid water; and (iii) the Archean had a biogenic disequilibrium caused by the coexistence of N2, CH4, CO2, and liquid water, which, for an exoplanet twin, may be remotely detectable. On the basis of this disequilibrium, we argue that the simultaneous detection of abundant CH4 and CO2 in a habitable exoplanet's atmosphere is a potential biosignature. Specifically, we show that methane mixing ratios greater than 10-3 are potentially biogenic, whereas those exceeding 10-2 are likely biogenic due to the difficulty in maintaining large abiotic methane fluxes to support high methane levels in anoxic atmospheres. Biogenicity would be strengthened by the absence of abundant CO, which should not coexist in a biological scenario.},

  abstract = {The search for life on exoplanets is motivated by the universal ways in which life could modify its planetary environment. Atmospheric gases such as oxygen and methane are promising candidates for such environmental modification due to the evolutionary benefits their production would confer. However, confirming that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or astrophysical processes, will require a thorough understanding of planetary context, including the expected counterfactual atmospheric evolution for lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding of planetary context for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We review the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen scenarios may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how planetary context controls non-biological methane (CH4) production is limited, even though CH4 biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres may be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental context for CH4 biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH4 coexisting with CO2, and CO:CH4 {$\ll$} 1 is suggestive of biological production, although precise thresholds are dependent on stellar context and sparsely characterized abiotic CH4 scenarios. A planetary context framework is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the distribution of life in the Universe, observations of terrestrial exoplanets in coming decades will provide a quantitative understanding of the atmospheric evolution of lifeless worlds. This knowledge will inform future instrument requirements to either corroborate the presence of life elsewhere or confirm its apparent absence.},

Given the similar densities of Trappist-1 planets, and the theoretical potential for atmospheric erosion around late M-dwarfs, this observation might be assumed to imply substantial atmospheres are also unlikely for the outer planets. However, the processes governing atmosphere erosion and replenishment are fundamentally different for inner and outer planets. Here, an atmosphere-interior evolution model is used to show that an airless Trappist-1b (and c) only weakly constrains stellar evolution, and that the odds of outer planets e and f retaining substantial atmospheres remain largely unchanged. This is true even if the initial volatile inventories of planets in the Trappist-1 system are highly correlated. The reason for this result is that b and c sit unambiguously interior to the runaway greenhouse limit, and so have potentially experienced {\textasciitilde}8 Gyr of XUV-driven hydrodynamic escape; complete atmospheric erosion in this environment only weakly constrains stellar evolution and escape parameterizations. In contrast, e and f reside within the habitable zone, and likely experienced a comparatively short steam atmosphere during Trappist-1's pre-main sequence, and consequently complete atmospheric erosion remains unlikely across a broad swath of parameter space (e and f retain atmospheres in {\textasciitilde}98\% of model runs). Naturally, it is still possible that all Trappist-1 planets formed volatile-poor and are all airless today. But the airlessness of b (and c) does not require this, and as such, JWST transit spectroscopy of e and f remains the best near-term opportunity to characterize the atmospheres of habitable zone terrestrial planets.},

This is important, for instance, for exoplanetary studies, because the level of stellar activity influences habitability.

The magnetic field grows by means of the recently identified gravitational instability dynamo (Riols \&amp; Latter 2018; Deng et al. 2020). Clumps are identified and their evolution is tracked finely both backward and forward in time. Their properties and evolutionary path is compared to clumps in companion simulations without magnetic fields. We find that magnetic and rotational energy are important in the clumps' outer regions, while in the cores, despite appreciable magnetic field amplification, thermal pressure is most important in counteracting gravity. Turbulent kinetic energy is of a smaller scale than magnetic energy in the clumps. Compared to non-magnetized clumps, rotation is less prominent, which results in lower angular momentum in much better agreement with observations. In order to understand the very low sub-Jovian masses of clumps forming in MHD simulations, we revisit the perturbation theory of magnetized sheets finding support for a previously proposed magnetic destabilization in low-shear regions. This can help explaining why fragmentation ensues on a scale more than an order of magnitude smaller than that of the Toomre mass. The smaller fragmentation scale and the high magnetic pressure in clumps' envelopes explain why clumps in magnetized disks are typically in the super-Earth to Neptune mass regime rather than Super-Jupiters as in conventional disk instability. Our findings put forward a viable alternative to core accretion to explain widespread formation of intermediate-mass planets.},

  abstract = {Recent discoveries of Earth-sized planets transiting nearby M dwarfs have made it possible to characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial planets via follow-up spectroscopic observations. However, the number of such planets receiving low insolation is still small, limiting our ability to understand the diversity of the atmospheric composition and climates of temperate terrestrial planets. We report the discovery of an Earth-sized planet transiting the nearby (12 pc) inactive M3.0 dwarf Gliese 12 (TOI-6251) with an orbital period (P orb) of 12.76 days. The planet, Gliese 12 b, was initially identified as a candidate with an ambiguous P orb from TESS data. We confirmed the transit signal and P orb using ground-based photometry with MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT3, and validated the planetary nature of the signal using high-resolution images from Gemini/NIRI and Keck/NIRC2 as well as radial velocity (RV) measurements from the InfraRed Doppler instrument on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope and from CARMENES on the CAHA 3.5 m telescope. X-ray observations with XMM-Newton showed the host star is inactive, with an X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of . Joint analysis of the light curves and RV measurements revealed that Gliese 12 b has a radius of 0.96 {\textpm} 0.05 R {$\oplus$}, a 3{$\sigma$} mass upper limit of 3.9 M {$\oplus$}, and an equilibrium temperature of 315 {\textpm} 6 K assuming zero albedo. The transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) value of Gliese 12 b is close to the TSM values of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, adding Gliese 12 b to the small list of potentially terrestrial, temperate planets amenable to atmospheric characterization with JWST.},

  abstract = {The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as \${\textbackslash}tau\$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).},

We aim at understanding the limitations associated with the characterization of long-period giant radial velocity planets, and to estimate their impact on the radial distribution of these planets. Methods. We revisit the results obtained by two major surveys that derived such radial distributions, using the RV data available at the time of the surveys as well as, whenever possible, new data. Results. We show that the radial distributions published beyond (5-8 au) are not secure. More precisely, the decrease of the radial distribution beyond the peak at 1-3 au is not confirmed.},

  abstract = {Since the Archean, N2 has been a major atmospheric constituent in Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is an essential element in the building blocks of life; therefore, the geobiological nitrogen cycle is a fundamental factor in the long-term evolution of both Earth and Earth-like exoplanets. We discuss the development of Earth's N2 atmosphere since the planet's formation and its relation with the geobiological cycle. Then we suggest atmospheric evolution scenarios and their possible interaction with life-forms: first for a stagnant-lid anoxic world, second for a tectonically active anoxic world, and third for an oxidized tectonically active world. Furthermore, we discuss a possible demise of present Earth's biosphere and its effects on the atmosphere. Since life-forms are the most efficient means for recycling deposited nitrogen back into the atmosphere at present, they sustain its surface partial pressure at high levels. Also, the simultaneous presence of significant N2 and O2 is chemically incompatible in an atmosphere over geological timescales. Thus, we argue that an N2-dominated atmosphere in combination with O2 on Earth-like planets within circumstellar habitable zones can be considered as a geo-biosignature. Terrestrial planets with such atmospheres will have an operating tectonic regime connected with an aerobic biosphere, whereas other scenarios in most cases end up with a CO2-dominated atmosphere. We conclude with implications for the search for life on Earth-like exoplanets inside the habitable zones of M to K stars.},

  abstract = {Detecting H2O in exoplanet atmospheres is the first step on the path to determining planet habitability. Coronagraphic design currently limits the observing strategy used to detect H2O, requiring the choice of specific bandpasses to optimize abundance constraints. In order to examing the optimal observing strategy for initial characterization of habitable planets using coronagraph-based direct imaging, we quantify the detectability of H2O as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and molecular abundance across 25 bandpasses in the visible wavelength range (0.5-1 micron). We use a pre-constructed grid consisting of 1.4 million geometric albedo spectra across a range of abundance and pressure, and interpolate the produce forward models for an efficient nested sampling routine, PSGnest. We first test the detectability of H2O in atmospheres that mimix a modern-Earth twin, and then expand to examine a wider range of H2O abundances; for each abundance value, we constrain the optimal 20\% bandpasses based on the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. We present our findings of H2O detectability as functions of SNR, wavelength, and abundance, and discuss how to use these results for optimizing future coronographic instrument design. We find that there are specific points in wavelength where H2o can be detected down to 0.74 micron with moderate-SNR data for abundances at the upper end of Earth's presumed historical values, while at 0.9 micron, detectability is possible with low-SNR data at modern Earth abundances of H2O.},

  abstract = {Various interactions affect the population of close-in planets. Among them, the tidal and magnetic interactions drive orbital decay and star-planet angular momentum exchange, leading to stellar spin-up. As a result of the above processes, a planet may initiate the mass transfer to the host star once it encounters the Roche limit. Another mechanism providing substantial mass loss is associated with the atmospheric escape caused by photoevaporation followed by orbital expansion, which is thought to be important for hot Neptunes and super-Earths. Thus, the fraction of the initial number of hot Jupiters may transform into lower-mass planets through the Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) phase and continue secular evolution under the effect of photoevaporation. In the present paper, we compile the latest prescriptions for tidal and magnetic migration and mass-loss rates to explore the dynamics of hot Jupiter systems. We study how the implemented interactions shape the orbital architecture of Jovian planets and whether their impact is enough to reproduce the observational sample. Our models suggest that the tidal interaction is able to generate the upper boundary of the hot Jupiter population in the mass-separation diagram. To recreate the sub-Jovian desert, we need to make additional assumptions regarding the RLO phase or the influence of the protoplanetary disc's inner edge on the initial planetary location. According to our estimates, 12-15\% of hot Jupiters around solar-mass stars have been engulfed or become lower-mass planets. 0.20-0.25\% of the present-day giant planet population undergoes decay intense enough to be detected with modern facilities.},

  abstract = {The inner edge of the classical habitable zone is often defined by the critical flux needed to trigger the runaway greenhouse instability. This 1D notion of a critical flux, however, may not be so relevant for inhomogeneously irradiated planets, or when the water content is limited (land planets). Here, based on results from our 3D global climate model, we find that the circulation pattern can shift from super-rotation to stellar/anti stellar circulation when the equatorial Rossby deformation radius significantly exceeds the planetary radius. Using analytical and numerical arguments, we also demonstrate the presence of systematic biases between mean surface temperatures or temperature profiles predicted from either 1D or 3D simulations. Including a complete modeling of the water cycle, we further demonstrate that for land planets closer than the inner edge of the classical habitable zone, two stable climate regimes can exist. One is the classical runaway state, and the other is a collapsed state where water is captured in permanent cold traps. We identify this "moist" bistability as the result of a competition between the greenhouse effect of water vapor and its condensation. We also present synthetic spectra showing the observable signature of these two states. Taking the example of two prototype planets in this regime, namely Gl581c and HD85512b, we argue that they could accumulate a significant amount of water ice at their surface. If such a thick ice cap is present, gravity driven ice flows and geothermal flux should come into play to produce long-lived liquid water at the edge and/or bottom of the ice cap. Consequently, the habitability of planets at smaller orbital distance than the inner edge of the classical habitable zone cannot be ruled out. Transiting planets in this regime represent promising targets for upcoming observatories like EChO and JWST.},

  abstract = {A recent experiment showed that, contrary to theoretical predictions, beyond a cutoff point, grinding coffee more finely results in lower extraction. One potential explanation for this is that fine grinding promotes non-uniform extraction in the coffee bed. We investigate the possibility that this could occur due the interaction between dissolution and flow promoting uneven extraction. A low dimensional model in which there are two possible pathways for flow is derived and analyzed. This model shows that, below a critical grind size, there is a decreasing extraction with decreasing grind size as is seen experimentally. This is due to a complicated interplay between an initial imbalance in the porosities and permeabilities of the two pathways in the model, which is increased by flow and extraction, leading to the complete extraction of all soluble coffee from one pathway.},

  abstract = {In the conventional habitable zone (HZ) concept, a CO2-H2O greenhouse maintains surface liquid water. Through the water-mediated carbonate-silicate weathering cycle, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) responds to changes in surface temperature, stabilizing the climate over geologic timescales. We show that this weathering feedback ought to produce a log-linear relationship between pCO2 and incident flux on Earth-like planets in the HZ. However, this trend has scatter because geophysical and physicochemical parameters can vary, such as land area for weathering and CO2 outgassing fluxes. Using a coupled climate and carbonate-silicate weathering model, we quantify the likely scatter in pCO2 with orbital distance throughout the HZ. From this dispersion, we predict a two-dimensional relationship between incident flux and pCO2 in the HZ and show that it could be detected from at least 83 (2{$\sigma$}) Earth-like exoplanet observations. If fewer Earth-like exoplanets are observed, testing the HZ hypothesis from this relationship could be difficult.},

  abstract = {A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$}, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of ) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.}},

  abstract = {We address a recently posed question: `Why Do So Many Astronomy (and Astrobiology) Discoveries Fail to Live Up to the Hype?' We expand it to cover hype within science in general. Our answer relies on working definitions of hype and skin in the game, as applied to research science, and a game theory model for the stability of cooperative science. Low skin in the game allows internal feedbacks, within the research science community, to initiate increased hype and a drift toward structural instability. The instability leads to the deterioration of cooperative equilibria, which further enhances hype. Along the drift, the number of results hyped as breakthroughs will increase and more claims will fail to live up to the hype. This can lead to the public perception that science is moving backwards and a shift in the perception of what scientists, and science, values. Although a hype instability can be initiated by external nudges, a bigger role is played by the internal dynamics of the system, i.e. the collective of working scientists. Corrections for a drift toward instability should, likewise, focus on internal structure. Proposed external shifts on how research is disseminated will add restrictions to a system that can do more harm than good.},

However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained3, and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anti-correlated with initial 26Al levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals8 before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation9,10 of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets11. Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high-26Al systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of 26Al predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10\% larger than for planets from the 26Al-rich formation scenario.},

The global efficacy of these mechanisms, however, hinges on the transfer of reduced iron from the molten silicate mantle to the metal core. Scaling analysis indicates that turbulent diffusion in the internal magma oceans of sub-Neptunes can kinetically entrain liquid iron droplets and quench core formation. This suggests that the chemical equilibration between core, mantle, and atmosphere may be energetically limited by convective overturn in the magma flow. Hence, molten super-Earths possibly retain a compositional memory of their accretion path. Redox control by magma ocean circulation is positively correlated with planetary heat flow, internal gravity, and planet size. The presence and speciation of remanent atmospheres, surface mineralogy, and core mass fraction of primary envelope-stripped exoplanets may thus constrain magma ocean dynamics.},

We connect numerical models of volatile chemistry and pebble coagulation in the circumstellar disk with the internal compositional evolution of planetesimals during the primary accretion phase. Our simulations demonstrate that disk chemistry and degassing from planetesimals operate on comparable timescales and can fractionate the relative abundances of major water and carbon carriers by orders of magnitude. As a result, individual planetary systems with significant planetesimal processing display increased correlation in the volatile budget of planetary building blocks relative to no internal heating. Planetesimal processing in a subset of systems increases the variance of volatile contents across planetary systems. Our simulations thus suggest that exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may provide constraints on when a specific planet formed.},

  abstract = {The earliest atmospheres of rocky planets originate from extensive volatile release during magma ocean epochs that occur during assembly of the planet. These establish the initial distribution of the major volatile elements between different chemical reservoirs that subsequently evolve via geological cycles. Current theoretical techniques are limited in exploring the anticipated range of compositional and thermal scenarios of early planetary evolution, even though these are of prime importance to aid astronomical inferences on the environmental context and geological history of extrasolar planets. Here, we present a coupled numerical framework that links an evolutionary, vertically resolved model of the planetary silicate mantle with a radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. Using this method, we investigate the early evolution of idealized Earth-sized rocky planets with end-member, clear-sky atmospheres dominated by either H2, H2O, CO2, CH4, CO, O2, or N2. We find central metrics of early planetary evolution, such as energy gradient, sequence of mantle solidification, surface pressure, or vertical stratification of the atmosphere, to be intimately controlled by the dominant volatile and outgassing history of the planet. Thermal sequences fall into three general classes with increasing cooling timescale: CO, N2, and O2 with minimal effect, H2O, CO2, and CH4 with intermediate influence, and H2 with several orders of magnitude increase in solidification time and atmosphere vertical stratification. Our numerical experiments exemplify the capabilities of the presented modeling framework and link the interior and atmospheric evolution of rocky exoplanets with multiwavelength astronomical observations.},

While geochemical evidence supports a dry, highly reduced late veneer on Earth, the composition of late-impacting debris around lower-mass stars is subject to variable volatile loss as a result of their hosts' extended pre-main sequence phase. We perform simulations of late-stage planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum to derive upper limits on reducing bombardment epochs in Hadean analog environments. We contrast the Solar System scenario with varying initial volatile distributions due to extended primordial runaway greenhouse phases on protoplanets and desiccation of smaller planetesimals by internal radiogenic heating. We find a decreasing rate of late-accreting reducing impacts with decreasing stellar mass. Young planets around stars \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 0.4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ experience no impacts of sufficient mass to generate prebiotically relevant concentrations of reduced atmospheric compounds once their stars have reached the main sequence. For M-dwarf planets to not exceed Earth-like concentrations of volatiles, both planetesimals and larger protoplanets must undergo extensive devolatilization processes and can typically emerge from long-lived magma ocean phases with sufficient atmophile content to outgas secondary atmospheres. Our results suggest that transiently reducing surface conditions on young rocky exoplanets are favoured around FGK- stellar types relative to M-dwarfs.},

For this purpose, the photometric data of 40 nearby ultra-cool dwarfs were reanalysed in a self-consistent and fully automated manner starting from the raw images. The pipeline developed specifically for this task generates differential light curves, removes non-planetary photometric features and stellar variability, and searches for transits. It identifies the transits of TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c without any human intervention. To test the pipeline and the potential output of similar surveys, we injected planetary transits into the light curves on a star-by-star basis and tested whether the pipeline is able to detect them. The achieved photometric precision enables us to identify Earth-sized planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs as validated by the injection tests. Our planet-injection simulation further suggests a lower limit of 10 per cent on the occurrence rate of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1b with a radius between 1 and 1.3 \$R\_{\textbackslash}backslashoplus\$ and the orbital period between 1.4 and 1.8 days.},

  abstract = {The geology of Earth and super-Earth sized planets will, in many cases, only be observable via their atmospheres. Here, we investigate secondary volcanic atmospheres as a key base case of how atmospheres may reflect planetary geochemistry. We couple volcanic outgassing with atmospheric chemistry models to simulate the growth of C-O-H-S-N atmospheres in thermochemical equilibrium, focusing on what information about the planet's mantle fO2 and bulk silicate H/C ratio could be determined by atmospheric observation. 800 K volcanic atmospheres develop distinct compositional groups as the mantle fO2 is varied, which can be identified using sets of (often minor) indicator species: Class O, representing an oxidized mantle and containing SO2 and sulfur allotropes; Class I, formed by intermediate mantle fO2's and containing CO2, CH4, CO and COS; and Class R, produced by reduced mantles, containing H2, NH3 and CH4. These atmospheric classes are robust to a wide range of bulk silicate H/C ratios. However, the H/C ratio does affect the dominant atmospheric constituent, which can vary between H2, H2O and CO2 once the chemical composition has stabilized to a point where it no longer changes substantially with time. This final atmospheric state is dependent on the mantle fO2, the H/C ratio, and time since the onset of volcanism. The atmospheric classes we present are appropriate for the closed-system growth of hot exoplanets, and may be used as a simple base for future research exploring the effects of other open-system processes on secondary volcanic atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The detection of habitable worlds is one of humanity's greatest endeavors. Thus far, astrobiological studies have shown that one of the most critical components for allowing life to develop is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to dissolve and, hence, transport other substances makes this constituent a key piece in this regard. As a consequence, looking for life as we know it is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection of life in distant planetary systems, this essentially means looking for planets in the so-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts to search for planets in this range of distances. Contrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet detection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to M-dwarfs, stellar activity is on a much smaller scale, hence, it has a smaller impact in terms of both the detectability and the true habitability of the planet. Also, K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise. In spite of this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In response to a call for legacy programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have initiated the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around these stars: K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the CARMENES instrument over five semesters, with an average of 90 data points per target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability limits, we expect to find 1.68 {\textpm} 0.25 planets per star in the KOBE sample. Furthermore, in half of the sample, we expect to find one of those planets within the habitable zone. Here, we describe the motivations, goals, and target selection for the project as well as the preliminary stellar characterization.},

  abstract = {The highest priority recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for space-based astronomy was the construction of an observatory capable of characterizing habitable worlds. In this paper series we explore the detectability of and interference from exomoons and exorings serendipitously observed with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as it seeks to characterize exoplanets, starting in this manuscript with Earth-Moon analog mutual events. Unlike transits, which only occur in systems viewed near edge-on, shadow (i.e., solar eclipse) and lunar eclipse mutual events occur in almost every star-planet-moon system. The cadence of these events can vary widely from {\textasciitilde}yearly to multiple events per day, as was the case in our younger Earth-Moon system. Leveraging previous space-based (EPOXI) lightcurves of a Moon transit and performance predictions from the LUVOIR-B concept, we derive the detectability of Moon analogs with HWO. We determine that Earth-Moon analogs are detectable with observation of {\textasciitilde}2-20 mutual events for systems within 10pc, and larger moons should remain detectable out to 20pc. We explore the extent to which exomoon mutual events can mimic planet features and weather. We find that HWO wavelength coverage in the near-IR, specifically in the 1.4 micron water band where large moons can outshine their host planet, will aid in differentiating exomoon signals from exoplanet variability. Finally, we predict that exomoons formed through collision processes akin to our Moon are more likely to be detected in younger systems, where shorter orbital periods and favorable geometry enhance the probability and frequency of mutual events.},

  abstract = {Binary evolution theory predicts that the second common envelope (CE) ejection can produce low-mass (0.32-0.36 Msun) subdwarf B (sdB) stars inside ultrashort-orbital-period binary systems, as their helium cores are ignited under nondegenerate conditions. With the orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, the minimum orbital periods of detached sdB binaries could be as short as {\textasciitilde}20 minutes. However, only four sdB binaries with orbital periods below an hour have been reported so far, while none of them has an orbital period approaching the above theoretical limit. Here we report the discovery of a 20.5-minute-orbital-period ellipsoidal binary, TMTS J052610.43+593445.1, in which the visible star is being tidally deformed by an invisible carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) companion. The visible component is inferred to be an sdB star with a mass of {\textasciitilde}0.33 Msun, approaching that of helium-ignition limit, although a He-core WD cannot be completely ruled out. In particular, the radius of this low-mass sdB star is only 0.066 Rsun, about seven Earth radii, possibly representing the most compact nondegenerate star ever known. Such a system provides a key clue to map the binary evolution scheme from the second CE ejection to the formation of AM CVn stars having a helium-star donor, and it will also serve as a crucial verification binary of space-borne GW detectors in the future.},

Models trained with deep neural network, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms utilize four flare light-curve characteristics as input features. Model performance is evaluated using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score metrics, all exceeding 94\%. Validation against previously reported TESS M dwarf flare identifications shows that our models successfully recover over 92\% of the flares while detecting {$\sim$}2000 more small events, thus extending the detection sensitivity of previous work. After processing 1.3 million light curves, our models identify nearly 18,000 flare stars and 250,000 flares. We present an extensive catalog documenting both flare and stellar properties. We find strong correlations of total flare energy and flare amplitude with color, in agreement with previous studies. Flare frequency distributions are analyzed, refining power-law slopes for flare behavior with frequency uncertainties due to the detection incompleteness of low-amplitude events. We determine rotation periods for {$\sim$}120,000 stars thus yielding the relationship between rotation period and flare activity. We find that the transition in rotation period between the saturated and unsaturated regimes in flare energy coincides with the same transition in rotation period separating the saturated and unsaturated levels in coronal X-ray emission. We find that X-ray emission increases more rapidly with flare luminosity in earlier-type and unsaturated stars, indicating more efficient coronal heating in these objects. Additionally, we detect flares in white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, which likely arise from unresolved low-mass companions.},

  abstract = {Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system (SS) analog, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our Solar System as viewed from a distance and based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth-Moon Barycenter, as influenced by the other SS bodies, with varying noise levels and observing durations. We then retrieve the system's dynamical parameters using an approximate N-body model for transit timing shifts while considering four possible plane-parallel configurations: two planets, three planets, four planets, and five planets. We demonstrate that -- with the retrieval applied to simulated transit times of Venus and EMB -- we can: 1) detect Jupiter at high significance (up to 90-s timing noise); 2) measure the masses and orbits of both transiting planets (mass-ratios are down to 4-8\% uncertainty for the 3-planet model) ; 3) detect Mars with more than \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ given very high level precision (10s of seconds). To accurately characterize Jupiter, we require timing precisions of better than 30 seconds and survey durations longer than 22 years. Accurate retrieval of Mars is possible when the survey baseline is longer than 25 years. Additionally, while Jupiter's mass is underestimated in most of our simulated cases, the addition of Mars improves the posterior mass, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems if they are nearly resonant to transiting planets. Ultimately, these simulations will help to guide future missions -- such as PLATO, Nautilus, LUVOIR, and Ariel -- in detecting and characterizing exoplanet systems analogous to our Solar System.},

This catalog contains 4376 transiting planet candidates, including 1791 residing within 709 multi-planet systems, and provides the best parameters available for a large sample of Kepler planet candidates. We also provide a second set of stellar and planetary properties for transiting candidates that are uniformly-derived for use in occurrence rates studies. Estimates of orbital periods have been improved, but as in previous catalogs, our tabulated values for period uncertainties do not fully account for transit timing variations (TTVs). We show that many planets are likely to have TTVs with long periodicities caused by various processes, including orbital precession, and that such TTVs imply that ephemerides of Kepler planets are not as accurate on multi-decadal timescales as predicted by the small formal errors (typically 1 part in \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ and rarely \$ {$>$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$) in the planets' measured mean orbital periods during the Kepler epoch. Analysis of normalized transit durations implies that eccentricities of planets are anti-correlated with the number of companion transiting planets. Our primary catalog lists all known Kepler planet candidates that orbit and transit only one star; for completeness, we also provide an abbreviated listing of the properties of the two dozen non-transiting planets that have been identified around stars that host transiting planets discovered by Kepler.},

However, the instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established5--9. Hydrodynamical modelling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital configuration in a chain of resonances2,10. Here we use dynamical simulations to show that the giant planets' instability was probably triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside out, its inner edge swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System11. Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant planet instability12,13; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth14.},

These "planet signatures" appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging due to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes, and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages, and therefore stars born together (i.e., co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate such detections. While previous spectroscopic studies were limited to small number of binary stars, the Gaia satellite provides new opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of 91 co-natal pairs of stars with a well-defined selection function and identify at least seven new instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of 8\%. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion. Our study provides new evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star-planet-chemistry connection by providing new observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution.},

Planets in the M-dwarf habitable zone are likely synchronously rotating, such that we expect significant day-night temperature differences, and potentially limited fractional habitability. Previous studies have focused on scenarios where fractional habitability is confined to the substellar or "eye" region, but in this paper we explore the possibility of planets with terminator habitability, defined by the existence of a habitable band at the transition between a scorching dayside and a glacial nightside. Using a global climate model, we show that for water-limited planets it is possible to have scorching temperatures in the "eye" and freezing temperatures on the nightside, while maintaining a temperate climate in the terminator region, due to a reduced atmospheric energy transport. Whereas on water-rich planets, increasing stellar flux leads to increased atmospheric energy transport and a reduction in day-night temperature differences, such that the terminator does not remain habitable once the dayside temperatures approach runaway or moist greenhouse limits. We also show that, while water-abundant simulations may result in larger fractional habitability, they are vulnerable to water loss through cold-trapping on the nightside surface or atmospheric water vapor escape, suggesting that even if planets were formed with abundant water, their climates could become water-limited and subject to terminator habitability.},

The first states that chemical energy available in submarine hydrothermal vents supported the formation of organic compounds and initiated primitive metabolic pathways which became incorporated in the earliest cells; the second proposes that protocells self-assembled from exogenous and geothermally-delivered monomers in freshwater hot springs. These alternative hypotheses are relevant to the fossil record of early life on Earth, and can be factored into the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System. This review summarizes the evidence supporting and challenging these hypotheses, and considers their implications for the search for life on various habitable worlds. It will discuss the relative probability that life could have emerged in environments on early Mars, on the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and also the degree to which prebiotic chemistry could have advanced on Titan. These environments will be compared to ancient and modern terrestrial analogs to assess their habitability and biopreservation potential. Origins of life approaches can guide the biosignature detection strategies of the next generation of planetary science missions, which could in turn advance one or both of the leading alternative abiogenesis hypotheses.},

Both the transition mass and the characteristic mass of planetesimals formed by the streaming instability increase with increasing distance from the star. We developed a model for the growth of a large planetesimal (embryo) embedded in a population of smaller planetesimals formed in a filament by the streaming instability. The model includes in a self-consistent way the collisional mass growth of the embryo, the fragmentation of the planetesimals, the velocity evolution of all involved bodies, as well as the viscous spreading of the filament. We find that the embryo accretes all available material in the filament during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc only in the inner regions of the disc. In contrast, we find little or no growth in the outer parts of the disc beyond 5--10 AU. Overall, our results demonstrate very long timescales for collisional growth of planetesimals in the regions of the protoplanetary disc where giant planets form. As such, in order to form giant planets in cold orbits, pebble accretion must act directly on the largest bodies present in the initial mass-function of planetesimals with little or no help from mutual collisions.},

  abstract = {Out of the more than 5,000 detected exoplanets a considerable number belongs to a category called 'mini-Neptunes'. Interior models of these planets suggest that they have some primordial, H-He dominated atmosphere. As this type of planet does not occur in the solar system, understanding their formation is a key challenge in planet formation theory. Unfortunately, quantifying the H-He, based on their observed mass and radius, is impossible due to the degeneracy of interior models. We explore the effects that different assumptions on planet formation have on the nebular gas accretion rate, particularly by exploring the way in which solid material interacts with the envelope. This allows us to estimate the range of possible post-formation primordial envelopes. Thereby we demonstrate the importance of envelope enrichment on the initial primordial envelope which can be used in evolution models. We apply formation models that include different solid accretion rate prescriptions. Our assumption is that mini-Neptunes form beyond the ice-line and migrate inward after formation, thus we form planets in-situ at 3 and 5 au. We consider that the envelope can be enriched by the accreted solids in the form of water. We study how different assumptions and parameters influence the ratio between the planet's total mass and the fraction of primordial gas. The primordial envelope fractions for small- and intermediate-mass planets (total mass below 15 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) can range from 0.1\% to 50\%. Envelope enrichment can lead to higher primordial mass fractions. We find that the solid accretion rate timescale has the largest influence on the primordial envelope size. Primordial gas accretion rates can span many orders of magnitude. Planet formation models need to use a self-consistent gas accretion prescription.},

These limitations will require crews to operate with greater autonomy than any past space mission has demonstrated. The Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) project, which regularly sends small teams of researchers to remote parts of the southern continent, resembles a space mission in many ways but does not rely upon a control center. It provides a useful crew autonomy model for planners of future deep space exploration missions. In contrast to current space missions, ANSMET gives the crew the authority to adjust competing work priorities, task assignments, and daily schedules; allows the crew to be the primary monitor of mission progress; demands greater crew accountability for operational errors; requires the crew to make the most of limited communication bandwidth; adopts systems designed for simple operation and failure recovery; and grants the crew a leading role in the selection and stowage of their equipment.},

One of the core issues stems from the culture of "work-above-life" associated with mission concepts, development, and implementation but also the expectations that seem to originate from numerous announcements from NASA (and other agencies). The benefits of work-life balance are well documented; however, the entire system surrounding research in Heliophysics hinders or discourages proper work-life balance. For example, there does not seem to be attention paid by NASA Headquarters (HQ) on the timing of their announcements regarding how it will be perceived by researchers, and how the timing may promote a culture where work trumps personal life. The same is true for remarks by NASA HQ program officers during panels or informal discussions, where seemingly innocuous comments may give a perception that work is expected after "normal" work hours. In addition, we are calling for work-life balance plans and implementation to be one of the criteria used for down-selection and confirmation of missions (Key Decision Points: KDP-B, KDP-C).},

  abstract = {We show that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs older than {$\sim$}1\,Gyr could have been in runaway greenhouses for several hundred million years following their formation due to the star's extended pre-main sequence phase, provided they form with abundant surface water. Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bar of abiotically produced O2, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O2 that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O2 builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: {$\sim$}5 bar/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to {$\sim$}25 bar/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bar of O2 due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low-mass stars.

  abstract = {The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

  abstract = {Water is an important component of exoplanets, with its distribution, that is, whether at the surface or deep inside, fundamentally influencing the planetary properties. The distribution of water in most exoplanets is determined by yet-unknown partition coefficients at extreme conditions. Here we first conduct ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the metal--silicate partition coefficients of water up to 1,000\,GPa and then model planet interiors by considering the effects of water content on density, melting temperature and water partitioning. Our calculations reveal that water strongly partitions into iron over silicate at high pressures and, thus, would preferentially stay in a planet's core. The results of our planet interior model challenge the notion of water worlds as imagined before: the majority of the bulk water budget (even more than 95\%) can be stored deep within the core and the mantle, and not at the surface. For planets more massive than {\textasciitilde}6\,M{$\bigoplus$} and Earth-size planets (of lower mass and small water budgets), the majority of water resides deep in the cores of planets. Whether water is assumed to be at the surface or at depth can affect the radius up to 15--25\% for a given mass. The exoplanets previously believed to be water-poor on the basis of mass--radius data may actually be rich in water.},

However, their composition, formation and evolution remain poorly understood3. The study of multiplanetary systems offers an opportunity to investigate the outcomes of planet formation and evolution while controlling for initial conditions and environment. Those in resonance (with their orbital periods related by a ratio of small integers) are particularly valuable because they imply a system architecture practically unchanged since its birth. Here we present the observations of six transiting planets around the bright nearby star HD\,110067. We find that the planets follow a chain of resonant orbits. A dynamical study of the innermost planet triplet allowed the prediction and later confirmation of the orbits of the rest of the planets in the system. The six planets are found to be sub-Neptunes with radii ranging from 1.94R{$\oplus$} to 2.85R{$\oplus$}. Three of the planets have measured masses, yielding low bulk densities that suggest the presence of large hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.},

The transmission spectrum rules out clear H\$\_2\$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.},

  abstract = {Rotational mapping and specular reflection (glint) are two proposed methods to directly detect liquid water on the surface of habitable exoplanets. However, false positives for both methods may prevent the unambiguous detection of exoplanet oceans. We use simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination of multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and accompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean detection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates, the glint spot appears to ``blink'' as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt the specular reflection from the ocean. This manifests itself as a strong source of periodic variability in crescent-phase disk-integrated reflected light curves. We invert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent albedo of multiple surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to the contribution from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant change in apparent albedo with phase. The presence of forward-scattering clouds in our simulated observation increases the overall reflectivity toward crescent, but we find that clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct from cloud scattering. Retrieving the same longitudinal map at quadrature and crescent phases may be used to tie changes in the apparent albedo with phase back to specific geographic surfaces (or longstanding atmospheric features), although this requires ideal geometries. We estimate that crescent-phase time-dependent glint measurements are feasible for between 1 and 10 habitable zone exoplanets orbiting the nearest G, K, and M dwarfs using a space-based, high-contrast, direct-imaging telescope with a diameter between 6 and 15 m.},

  abstract = {With the growing number of spectroscopic observations and observational platforms capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization, there is a growing need for analysis techniques that can distill information about a large population of exoplanets into a coherent picture of atmospheric trends expressed within the statistical sample. In this work, we develop a Hierarchical Bayesian Atmospheric Retrieval (HBAR) model to infer population-level trends in exoplanet atmospheric characteristics. We demonstrate HBAR on the case of inferring a trend in atmospheric CO2 with incident stellar flux, predicted by the presence of a functioning carbonate-silicate weathering negative feedback cycle, an assumption upon which all calculations of the habitable zone (HZ) rest. Using simulated transmission spectra and JWST-quality observations of rocky planets with H2O, CO2, and N2 bearing atmospheres, we find that the predicted trend in CO2 causes subtle differences in the spectra of order 10 ppm in the 1-5 um range, underscoring the challenge inherent to testing this hypothesis. In the limit of highly precise data (100 stacked transits per planet), we show that our HBAR model is capable of inferring the population-level parameters that characterize the trend in CO2, and we demonstrate that the null hypothesis and other simpler trends can be rejected at high confidence. Although we find that this specific empirical test of the HZ may be prohibitively challenging in the JWST era, the HBAR framework developed in this work may find a more immediate usage for the analysis of gas giant spectra observed with JWST, Ariel, and other upcoming missions.}

With densities between those of rocky super-Earths and more extended mini-Neptunes, Hycean planets can be optimal candidates in the search for exoplanetary habitability and may be abundant in the exoplanet population. We investigate the bulk properties (masses, radii, and temperatures), potential for habitability, and observable biosignatures of Hycean planets. We show that Hycean planets can be significantly larger compared to previous considerations for habitable planets, with radii as large as 2.6 R {$\oplus$} (2.3 R {$\oplus$}) for a mass of 10 M {$\oplus$} (5 M {$\oplus$}). We construct the Hycean habitable zone (HZ), considering stellar hosts from late M to Sun-like stars, and find it to be significantly wider than the terrestrial-like HZ. While the inner boundary of the Hycean HZ corresponds to equilibrium temperatures as high as {$\sim$}500 K for late M dwarfs, the outer boundary is unrestricted to arbitrarily large orbital separations. Our investigations include tidally locked ``Dark Hycean'' worlds that permit habitable conditions only on their permanent nightsides and ``Cold Hycean'' worlds that see negligible irradiation. Finally, we investigate the observability of possible biosignatures in Hycean atmospheres. We find that a number of trace terrestrial biomarkers that may be expected to be present in Hycean atmospheres would be readily detectable using modest observing time with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We identify a sizable sample of nearby potential Hycean planets that can be ideal targets for such observations in search of exoplanetary biosignatures.},

  abstract = {The search for habitable conditions and signs of life on exoplanets is a major frontier in modern astronomy. Detecting atmospheric signatures of Earth-like exoplanets is challenging due to their small sizes and relatively thin atmospheres. Recently, a new class of habitable sub-Neptune exoplanets, called Hycean worlds, has been theorized. Hycean worlds are planets with H2-rich atmospheres and planet-wide oceans with thermodynamic conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans. Their large sizes and extended atmospheres, compared to rocky planets of similar mass, make Hycean worlds significantly more accessible to atmospheric observations. These planets open a new avenue in the search for planetary habitability and life elsewhere using spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We observed the transmission spectrum of a candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, recently with JWST in its first year of operations. The spectrum reveals multiple spectral features of carbon bearing molecules in the planetary atmosphere, leading to the first detections of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a habitable-zone exoplanet. We discuss inferences of the atmospheric chemical composition and its implications for the atmospheric, interior and surface conditions on the planet, along with the possibility of a habitable ocean underneath the atmosphere. We discuss new observational and theoretical developments in this emerging frontier and their implications for exoplanetary habitability and search for life elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial exoplanets in habitable zones are ubiquitous. It is, however, unknown which have Earth-like or Venus-like climates. Distinguishing different planet-types is crucial for determining whether a planet could be habitable. We investigate the potential of polarimetry for distinguishing exo-Earths from exo-Venuses. We present computed fluxes and polarisation of starlight that is reflected by exoplanets with atmospheres in evolutionary states from current Earth to current Venus, with cloud compositions ranging from pure water to 0.75 sulfuric acid solution, for wavelengths between 0.3 and 2.5 microns. The polarisation of the reflected light shows larger variations with the planetary phase angle than the total flux. Across the visible, the largest polarisation is reached for an Earth-like atmosphere with water clouds, due to Rayleigh scattering above the clouds and the rainbow near 40 deg phase angle. In the near-infrared, the planet with a Venus-like CO2 atmosphere and thin water clouds shows the most prominent polarisation features due to scattering by the small cloud droplets. A planet around Alpha Centauri A would leave temporal variations on the order of 10E-13 W/m3 in the reflected flux and 10E-11 in the degree of polarisation along the planet's orbit for a spatially unresolved star-planet system. Star-planet contrasts are on the order of 10E-10. Current polarimeters cannot distinguish between the possible evolutionary phases of spatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets, as a sensitivity near 10E-10 is required to discern the planet signal on the background of unpolarised starlight. Telescopes capable of reaching planet-star contrasts lower than 10E-9 should be able to observe the variation of the planet's resolved degree of polarisation as a function of its phase angle and thus to discern an exo-Earth from an exo-Venus based on its clouds' unique polarisation signatures.},

  abstract = {The question of the origin of life is a tenacious question that challenges many branches of science but is also extremely multifaceted. While prebiotic chemistry and micropaleontology reformulate the question as that of explaining the appearance of life on Earth in the deep past, systems chemistry and synthetic biology typically understand the question as that of demonstrating the synthesis of novel living matter from nonliving matter independently of historical constraints. The objective of this contribution is to disentangle the different readings of the origin-of-life question found in science. We identify three main dimensions along which the question can be differently constrained depending on context: historical adequacy, natural spontaneity, and similarity to life-as-we-know-it. We argue that the epistemic status of what needs to be explained---the explanandum---varies from approximately true when the origin-of-life question is the most constrained to entirely speculative when the constraints are the most relaxed. This difference in epistemic status triggers a shift in the nature of the origin-of-life question from an explanation-seeking question in the most constrained case to a fact-establishing question in the lesser-constrained ones. We furthermore explore how answers to some interpretations of the origin-of-life questions matter for other interpretations.},

  abstract = {The concept of a biosignature is widely used in astrobiology to suggest a link between some observation and a biological cause, given some context. The term itself has been defined and used in several ways in different parts of the scientific community involved in the search for past or present life on Earth and beyond. With the ongoing acceleration in the search for life in distant time and/or deep space, there is a need for clarity and accuracy in the formulation and reporting of claims. Here, we critically review the biosignature concept(s) and the associated nomenclature in light of several problems and ambiguities emphasized by recent works. One worry is that these terms and concepts may imply greater certainty than is usually justified by a rational interpretation of the data. A related worry is that terms such as ``biosignature'' may be inherently misleading, for example, because the divide between life and non-life---and their observable effects---is fuzzy. Another worry is that different parts of the multidisciplinary community may use non-equivalent or conflicting definitions and conceptions, leading to avoidable confusion. This review leads us to identify a number of pitfalls and to suggest how they can be circumvented. In general, we conclude that astrobiologists should exercise particular caution in deciding whether and how to use the concept of biosignature when thinking and communicating about habitability or life. Concepts and terms should be selected carefully and defined explicitly where appropriate. This would improve clarity and accuracy in the formulation of claims and subsequent technical and public communication about some of the most profound and important questions in science and society. With this objective in mind, we provide a checklist of questions that scientists and other interested parties should ask when assessing any reported detection of a ``biosignature'' to better understand exactly what is being claimed.},

We are developing GMagAO-X to be available at or shortly after first-light of the GMT, to enable early high contrast exoplanet science in response to the Astro2020 recommendations. A key science goal is the characterization of nearby potentially habitable terrestrial worlds. GMagAO-Xis a woofer-tweeter system, with integrated segment phasing control. The tweeter is a 21,000 actuator segmented deformable mirror, composed of seven 3000 actuator segments. A multi-stage wavefront sensing system provides for bootstrapping, phasing, and high order sensing. The entire instrument is mounted in a rotator to provide gravity invariance. After the main AO system, visible (g to y) and near-IR (Y to H) science channels contain integrated coronagraphic wavefront control systems. The fully corrected and, optionally, coronagraphically filtered beams will then be fed to a suite of focal plane instrumentation including imagers and spectrographs. This will include existing facility instruments at GMT via fiber feeds. To assess the design we have developed an end-to-end frequency-domain modeling framework for assessing the performance of GMagAO-X. The dynamics of the many closed-loop feedback control systems are then modeled. Finally, we employ a frequency-domain model of post-processing algorithms to analyze the final post-processed sensitivity. The CoDR for GMagAO-X was held in September, 2021. Here we present an overview of the science cases, instrument design, expected performance, and concept of operations for GMagAO-X.},

Our primary science goals are detection and characterization of Solar System-like exoplanets, ranging from very young, still-accreting planets detected at H-alpha, to older temperate planets which will be characterized using reflected starlight. First light was in Dec, 2019, but subsequent commissioning runs were canceled due to COVID19. In the interim, MagAO-X has served as a lab testbed. Highlights include implementation of several focal plane and low-order wavefront sensing algorithms, development of a new predictive control algorithm, and the addition of an IFU module. MagAO-X also serves as the AO system for the Giant Magellan Telescope High Contrast Adaptive Optics Testbed. We will provide an overview of these projects, and report the results of our commissioning and science run in April, 2022. Finally, we will present the status of a comprehensive upgrade to MagAO-X to enable extreme-contrast characterization of exoplanets in reflected light. These upgrades include a new post-AO 1000-actuator deformable mirror inside the coronagraph, latest generation sCMOS detectors for wavefront sensing, optimized PIAACMC coronagraphs, and computing system upgrades. When these Phase II upgrades are complete we plan to conduct a survey of nearby exoplanets in reflected light.},

TOI-1801 b was observed in TESS sectors 22 and 49, and the alert that this was a TESS planet candidate with a period of 21.3 days went out in April 2020. However, ground-based follow-up observations, including seeing-limited photometry in and outside transit together with precise radial velocity (RV) measurements with CARMENES and HIRES revealed that the true period of the planet is 10.6 days. These observations also allowed us to retrieve a mass of 5.74 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.46 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, which together with a radius of 2.08 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.12 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, means that TOI-1801 b is most probably composed of water and rock, with an upper limit of 2{\textbackslash}\% by mass of H\$\_\{2\}\$ in its atmosphere. The stellar rotation period of 16 days is readily detectable in our RV time series and in the ground-based photometry. We derived a likely age of 600--800 Myr for the parent star TOI-1801, which means that TOI-1801 b is the least massive young mini-Neptune with precise mass and radius determinations. Our results suggest that if TOI-1801 b had a larger atmosphere in the past, it must have been removed by some evolutionary mechanism on timescales shorter than 1 Gyr.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery, mass, and radius determination of TOI-1801 b, a temperate mini-Neptune around a young M dwarf. TOI-1801 b was observed in TESS sectors 22 and 49, and the alert that this was a TESS planet candidate with a period of 21.3 days went out in April 2020. However, ground-based follow-up observations, including seeing-limited photometry in and outside transit together with precise radial velocity (RV) measurements with CARMENES and HIRES revealed that the true period of the planet is 10.6 days. These observations also allowed us to retrieve a mass of 5.74 {\textpm} 1.46 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, which together with a radius of 2.08 {\textpm} 0.12 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, means that TOI-1801 b is most probably composed of water and rock, with an upper limit of 2\% by mass of H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$} in its atmosphere. The stellar rotation period of 16 days is readily detectable in our RV time series and in the ground-based photometry. We derived a likely age of 600--800 Myr for the parent star TOI-1801, which means that TOI-1801 b is the least massive young mini-Neptune with precise mass and radius determinations. Our results suggest that if TOI-1801 b had a larger atmosphere in the past, it must have been removed by some evolutionary mechanism on timescales shorter than 1 Gyr.}}}}}},

Understanding planet formation is important in the context of the origin of planetary systems in general and of the Solar System in particular, as well as to predict the likelihood of finding Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth analogues around other stars.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}.

  abstract = {NIRPS is a fiber-fed AO nIR spectrograph working simultaneously with HARPS at the La Silla-ESO 3.6m telescope. The cryogenic spectrograph operating at 75K employs a cross-dispersed echelle grating (R4), covering a wavelength range of 0.98-1.80 microns in a single image using a Teledyne Hawaii-4RG infrared detector. In early 2022, the NIRPS spectrograph was transported to Chile by plane with all the optical elements mechanically attached to the optical bench inside the vaccum vessel. To ensure the safety of the spectrograph, dedicated work was performed on the shipping crate design, which could survive up to 7g shocks. In La Silla, the vacuum vessel was re-integrated on its support structure and the spectrograph alignment was verified with the H4RG and the injection module. Given the optical design, the alignment phase was performed using a metrology arm and a few optical tests, which minimize the time required for this critical phase. From the validation/technical phase results, two major modifications were required. Firstly, the original grating element was replaced by a new etched crystalline silicon component made by the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering. A novel technique was developed to verify the alignment at a warm temperature with the H4RG detector. Secondly, a thermal enclosure was added around the vacuum vessel to optimize thermal stability. Since then, the long-term thermal stability has been better than 0.2mK over 20 days. In this paper, we will review the final spectrograph performances, prior to shipping, and describe the novel techniques developed to minimize shipping costs, AITV phase duration, and grating replacement at the observatory. Additionally, we will discuss the thermal enclosure design to achieve the sub-mK thermal stability.},

However, the mechanism that creates the valley is unknown. The low mean densities of sub-Neptunes imply that they formed within a few million years and accreted primordial envelopes. Because these planets receive X-ray and UV fluxes comparable to the gravitational binding energy of their envelopes, their atmospheres are susceptible to mass loss. We model the thermal and compositional evolution of sub-Neptunes undergoing escape with diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium and show that preferential loss of hydrogen can change their atmospheric compositions. Planets with radii between 1.6 and 2.5\,R{$\oplus$} can obtain atmospheric helium mass fractions in excess of 40\% from billions of years of photoevaporation. Such enhancement can be detected through transmission spectroscopy, providing a novel observational test to determine whether atmospheric escape creates the radius valley.},

  abstract = {Informed by the science cases and options for the LUVOIR and HabEx concepts, we present here a summary of an independent analysis by NASA ExEP to produce a list of priority target stars amenable to surveys for potentially habitable exoplanets via imaging with the {\textasciitilde}6-m IR/O/UV space observatory recommended by Astro2020. It is hoped that this list will stimulate investigations of the properties of these stars and their planetary systems to inform target prioritization and inform the modeling and interpretation of exoplanet spectra. To achieve the Decadal goal to "provide a robust sample of {\textasciitilde}25 atmospheric spectra of potentially habitable exoplanets," the observatory will have severe constraints on its survey capability given the limited number of nearby stars whose habitable zones (HZs) will be accessible to starlight suppression techs (e.g. coronagraph, starshade), and whose small planets will be bright enough to measure spectra on reasonable timescales. From a compiled input sample of {\textasciitilde}800 nearby stars, we conducted a thorough literature search for their basic properties and calculated magnitudes and angular separations for hypothetical small HZ planets. By consideration of the brightnesses, planet-star brightness ratios, and angular separations of hypothetical planets placed at various phase angles and orbital radii in the HZ, we iteratively down-selected stars that would have the brightest exo-Earths at the widest angular separations until {\textasciitilde}100 cumulative HZs were surveyed. The stars have mean(rms) values of: V=5.2(1.0)mag, Rc=4.8(0.9)mag, Dist=13(5)pc, Teff=5700(700)K, [Fe/H]=-0.1(0.2)dex, mass=1.0(0.2)Msun, log(L/Lsun)=0.0(0.5) dex. All are brighter than V{$<$}7.5 and Rc{$<$}6.4, with types between F1V and M2V, and maximum distances by spectral class of 4pc(M), 13pc(K), 21pc(G), and 24pc(F). Given reasonable assumptions about achievable exoplanet brightnesses and planet-star-brightness ratios, to get to {\textasciitilde}100 cumulative HZs surveyed, one requires a starlight suppression solution that enables detection and spectral characterization of exo-Earths down to inner working angles (IWAs) of {\textasciitilde}60-70 mas. The peer-reviewed ExEP target star catalog will be posted at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and updated periodically.},

A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x's and y's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x's and m y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) {$>$} g(x)\$ for every x.},

  abstract = {Secondary eclipse observations of several of the hottest hot Jupiters show featureless, blackbody-like spectra or molecular emission features, which are consistent with thermal inversions being present in those atmospheres. Theory predicts a transition between warmer atmospheres with thermal inversions and cooler atmospheres without inversions, but the exact transition point is unknown. In order to further investigate this issue, we observed two secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 instrument and combined these data with previous Spitzer and Kepler secondary eclipse observations. The HST and Spitzer data can be well fit by a blackbody with T = 2692 {\textpm} 14 K, and the Kepler data point constrains the geometric albedo to Ag = 0.077 {\textpm} 0.006. We modeled these data with a three-dimensional (3D) GCM and one-dimensional (1D) self-consistent forward models. The 1D models indicate that the atmosphere has a thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation that limits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3 observations of HAT-P-7b and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear blackbody-like because they probe a region near the tropopause where the atmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally, the 1D models constrain the atmospheric metallicity () and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O {$<$} 1 at 99\% confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches the Spitzer data but generally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce its featureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag or nightside clouds and may be better understood through further observation with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

However, it is still unknown whether such planets orbiting close to M dwarf stars can retain their atmospheres, or whether high-energy irradiation from the star will strip the gaseous envelopes from these objects. We present a new method to detect an atmosphere on a synchronously rotating rocky exoplanet around a K/M dwarf, by using thermal emission during secondary eclipse to infer a high dayside albedo that could only be explained by bright clouds. Based on calculations for plausible surface conditions, we conclude that a high albedo could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of an atmosphere for planets with substellar temperatures of Tsub = 410--1250 K. This range corresponds to equilibrium temperatures of Teq = 300--880 K. We compare the inferred albedos of eight possible planet surface compositions to cloud albedo calculations. We determine that a layer of clouds with optical depths greater than {$\tau$} = 0.5--7, would have high enough albedos to be distinguishable from a bare rock surface. This method of detecting an atmosphere on a rocky planet is complementary to existing methods for detecting atmospheres, because it provides a way to detect atmospheres with pressures below 1 bar (e.g., Mars), which are too tenuous to transport significant heat but thick enough to host high-albedo clouds.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets has revealed a wealth of information about their atmospheric compositions and thermal structures. In particular, studies of highly irradiated exoplanets at temperatures much higher than those found in our solar system have provided detailed information on planetary chemistry and physics because of the high level of precision which can be obtained from such observations. Here we use a variety of techniques to study the atmospheres of highly irradiated transiting exoplanets and address three large, open questions in exoplanet atmosphere spectroscopy. First, we use secondary eclipse and phase curve observations to investigate the thermal structures and heat redistribution of ultra-hot Jupiters, the hottest known exoplanets. We demonstrate how these planets form an unique class of objects influenced by high-temperature chemical effects such as molecular dissociation and H- opacity. Second, we use observations of helium in the upper atmosphere of the exo-Neptune HAT-P-11b to probe atmospheric escape processes. Third, we develop tools to interpret JWST observations of highly irradiated exoplanets, including a data analysis pipeline to perform eclipse mapping of hot Jupiters and a method to infer albedos of and detect atmospheres on hot, terrestrial planets. Finally, we discuss remaining open questions in the field of highly irradiated exoplanets and opportunities to advance our understanding of these unique bodies in the coming years.},

  abstract = {At the end of 2021, the ESO council approved the start of the construction phase for a High Resolution Spectrograph for the ELT, formerly known as ELT-HIRES, renamed recently as ANDES (ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph). The current initial schedule foresees a 9-years development aimed to bring the instrument on-sky soon after the first-generation ELT instruments. ANDES combines high spectral resolution (up to 100,000), wide spectral range (0.4 {\textmu}m to 1.8 {\textmu}m with a goal from 0.35 {\textmu}m to 2.4 {\textmu}m) and extreme stability in wavelength calibration accuracy (better than 0.02 m/s rms over a 10-year period in a selected wavelength range) with massive optical collecting power of the ELT thus enabling to achieve possible breakthrough groundbreaking scientific discoveries. The main science cases cover a possible detection of life signatures in exoplanets, the study of the stability of Nature's physical constants along the universe lifetime and a first direct measurement of the cosmic acceleration. The reference design of this instrument in its extended version (with goals included) foresees 4 spectrographic modules fed by fibers, operating in seeing and diffraction limited (adaptive optics assisted) mode carried out by an international consortium composed by 24 institutes from 13 countries which poses big challenges in several areas. In this paper we will describe the approach we intend to pursue to master management and system engineering aspects of this challenging instrument focused mainly on the preliminary design phase, but looking also ahead towards its final construction.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large ({$>$}2100 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}) field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We employ mask-based (aperture) photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. Each model was tested on synthetic images generated for 50 000 potential PLATO targets. We extracted the stellar population from the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 catalogue. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to {$\sim$}30\% less false transit signatures at 7.1\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$} detection threshold.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives for the PLATO mission. Overall, this work constitutes an important step in the design of both on-board and on-ground science data processing pipelines.}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The first generation of ELT instruments includes an optical-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, indicated as ELT-HIRES and recently christened ANDES (ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph). ANDES consists of three fibre-fed spectrographs ([U]BV, RIZ, YJH) providing a spectral resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim\$100,000 with a minimum simultaneous wavelength coverage of 0.4-1.8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m with the goal of extending it to 0.35-2.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m with the addition of a U arm to the BV spectrograph and a separate K band spectrograph. It operates both in seeing- and diffraction-limited conditions and the fibre feeding allows several, interchangeable observing modes including a single conjugated adaptive optics module and a small diffraction-limited integral field unit in the NIR. Modularity and fibre-feeding allow ANDES to be placed partly on the ELT Nasmyth platform and partly in the Coud{\textbackslash}'e room. ANDES has a wide range of groundbreaking science cases spanning nearly all areas of research in astrophysics and even fundamental physics. Among the top science cases, there are the detection of biosignatures from exoplanet atmospheres, finding the fingerprints of the first generation of stars, tests on the stability of Nature's fundamental couplings, and the direct detection of the cosmic acceleration. The ANDES project is carried forward by a large international consortium, composed of 35 Institutes from 13 countries, forming a team of almost 300 scientists and engineers which include the majority of the scientific and technical expertise in the field that can be found in ESO member states.},

We find that this methodology is suitable down to M7.0 V, where refractory metals such as Ti are expected to condense in the stellar photospheres. The derived \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$}, log\emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}, and [Fe/H] range from 3000 to 4200 K, 4.5 to 5.3 dex, and -0.7 to 0.2 dex, respectively.

Lastly, excellent agreement in \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} is found for M dwarfs with interferometric angular diameter measurements, as well as in the [Fe/H] between the components in the wide physical FGK+M and M+M systems included in our sample.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Since their discovery, hydrothermal vents have been relevant to concepts that surround the origin of life. At the simplest level, there are two kinds of hydrothermal vents: the hot (approximately 350{$^\circ$}C) black smoker type, the chemistry of which is driven by the magma-chamber that resides below ocean-floor spreading zones, and the cooler (approximately 50--90{$^\circ$}C) Lost City type, the chemistry of which is driven not by magma, but by a process called serpentinization.Serpentinization is a H2-producing geochemical reaction that has been operation in hydrothermal systems for as long as there has been water on the Earth. Its reducing power is sufficient to generate substantial amounts of abiogenic CH4 and short hydrocarbons in the effluent of some modern hydrothermal vents.In the study of the origin of life, major unresolved issues concern the source of sustained chemical energy and the source of reduced carbon compounds. The CO2-reducing geochemistry of modern hydrothermal vents provides a model for our understanding of how such processes might have been possible at the dawn of biochemistry.Methanogens and acetogens satisfy their carbon needs through the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway, an energy-releasing pathway of CO2 fixation, if given sufficient environmental H2 and CO2. The authors consider the idea that the CH4-producing and acetate-producing geochemistry of hydrothermal vents is the abiogenic precursor of modern microbial CH4 and acetate production.This suggests that the evolutionary starting point of microbial metabolism might have been an energy-releasing geochemical process in which CO2 served as the acceptor for electrons that stemmed from H2 generated by serpentinization. The naturally chemiosmotic nature of alkaline hydrothermal systems, such as Lost City, might be important to the origin of life issue, but in a somewhat unexpected way that, in turn, helps to explain why chemiosmotic coupling through ATPases is universal throughout the microbial world.},

We restrict our analysis to planets with directly measured masses and radii, which comprise a total of 70 planets: 30 singles and 40 multis in 19 systems. We compare the bulk densities for the full sample, which includes planets ranging in size from \$0.52 R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ to \$12.8R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, and find that single planets have significantly lower densities on average than multis, which we cannot attribute to selection biases. We compare the bulk densities normalized by an Earth model for planets with \$R\_\{p\} {$<$} 6R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, and find that multis are also denser with 99{\textbackslash}\% confidence. We calculate and compare the core/water mass fractions (CMF/WMF) of low-mass planets (\$M\_p {$<$}10 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), and find that the likely rocky multis (with \$R\_p {$<$}1.6 R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) have lower CMFs than singles. We also compare the [Fe/H] metallicity and rotation period of all single versus multi-planet host stars with such measurements in the literature and find that multi-planet hosts are significantly more metal-poor than those hosting a single planet. Moreover, we find that host star metallicity decreases with increasing planet multiplicity. In contrast, we find only a modest difference in the rotation period. The significant differences in planetary composition and metallicity of the host stars point to different physical processes governing the formation of single- and multi-planet systems in M dwarfs.},

Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual inclination distribution. We find \${\textbackslash}backslashsigma=11.8{\textasciicircum}\{+12.7\}\_\{-5.5\}{\textbackslash}backslash,{\textbackslash}backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (68\% confidence) and \${\textbackslash}backslashsigma{\textbackslash}textgreater3.5{\textbackslash}backslash,{\textbackslash}backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (95\% confidence), where \${\textbackslash}backslashsigma\$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar - although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean inclination from the invariable plane of \$1.8{\textbackslash}backslash,{\textbackslash}backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$. We also find evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of inner super-Earths.},

  abstract = {{$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: The connection between initial disc conditions and final orbital and physical properties of planets is not well-understood. In this paper, we numerically study the formation of planetary systems via pebble accretion and investigate the effects of disc properties such as masses, dissipation timescales, and metallicities on planet formation outcomes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We improved the N-body code SyMBA that was modified for our Paper I by taking account of new planet-disc interaction models and type II migration. We adopted the `two-{$\alpha$}' disc model to mimic the effects of both the standard disc turbulence and the mass accretion driven by the magnetic disc wind. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We successfully reproduced the overall distribution trends of semi-major axes, eccentricities, and planetary masses of extrasolar giant planets. There are two types of giant planet formation trends, depending on whether or not the disc's dissipation timescales are comparable to the planet formation timescales. When planet formation happens fast enough, giant planets are fully grown (Jupiter mass or higher) and are distributed widely across the disc. On the other hand, when planet formation is limited by the disc's dissipation, discs generally form low-mass cold Jupiters. Our simulations also naturally explain why hot Jupiters (HJs) tend to be alone and how the observed eccentricity-metallicity trends arise. The low-metallicity discs tend to form nearly circular and coplanar HJs in situ, because planet formation is slower than high-metallicity discs, and thus protoplanetary cores migrate significantly before gas accretion. The high-metallicity discs, on the other hand, generate HJs in situ or via tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits. Both pathways usually involve dynamical instabilities, and thus HJs tend to have broader eccentricity and inclination distributions. When giant planets with very wide orbits ("super-cold Jupiters") are formed via pebble accretion followed by scattering, we predict that they belong to metal-rich stars, have eccentric orbits, and tend to have ({\textasciitilde}80\%) companions interior to their orbits.},

  abstract = {The PLATO mission is scheduled for launch in 2026. This study aims to estimate the number of exoplanets that PLATO can detect as a function of planetary size and period, stellar brightness, and observing strategy options. Deviations from these estimates will be informative of the true occurrence rates of planets, which helps constraining planet formation models. For this purpose, we developed the Planet Yield for PLATO estimator (PYPE), which adopts a statistical approach. We apply given occurrence rates from planet formation models and from different search and vetting pipelines for the Kepler data. We estimate the stellar sample to be observed by PLATO using a fraction of the all-sky PLATO stellar input catalog (PIC). PLATO detection efficiencies are calculated under different assumptions that are presented in detail in the text. The results presented here primarily consider the current baseline observing duration of four years. We find that the expected PLATO planet yield increases rapidly over the first year and begins to saturate after two years. A nominal (2+2) four-year mission could yield about several thousand to several tens of thousands of planets, depending on the assumed planet occurrence rates. We estimate a minimum of 500 Earth-size (0.8-1.25 RE) planets, about a dozen of which would reside in a 250-500d period bin around G stars. We find that one-third of the detected planets are around stars bright enough (V \${\textbackslash}leq 11\$) for RV-follow-up observations. We find that a three-year-long observation followed by 6 two-month short observations (3+1 years) yield roughly twice as many planets as two long observations of two years (2+2 years). The former strategy is dominated by short-period planets, while the latter is more beneficial for detecting earths in the habitable zone.},

  abstract = {The search for rocky planet atmospheres with JWST has focused on planets transiting M dwarfs. Such planets have favorable planet-to-star size ratios, enhancing the amplitude of atmospheric features. Since the expected signal strength of atmospheric features is similar to the single-transit performance of JWST, multiple observations are required to confirm any detection. Here, we present two transit observations of the rocky planet GJ 1132 b with JWST NIRSpec G395H, covering 2.8-5.2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. Previous HST WFC3 observations of GJ 1132 b were inconclusive, with evidence reported for either an atmosphere or a featureless spectrum based on analyses of the same dataset. Our JWST data exhibit substantial differences between the two visits. One transit is consistent with either a H\$\_2\$O-dominated atmosphere containing {\textasciitilde}1\% CH\$\_4\$ and trace N\$\_2\$O (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\$ = 1.13) or stellar contamination from unocculted starspots (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\$ = 1.36). However, the second transit is consistent with a featureless spectrum. Neither visit is consistent with a previous report of HCN. Atmospheric variability is unlikely to explain the scale of the observed differences between the visits. Similarly, our out-of-transit stellar spectra show no evidence of changing stellar inhomogeneity between the two visits - observed 8 days apart, only 6.5\% of the stellar rotation rate. We further find no evidence of differing instrumental systematic effects between visits. The most plausible explanation is an unlucky random noise draw leading to two significantly discrepant transmission spectra. Our results highlight the importance of multi-visit repeatability with JWST prior to claiming atmospheric detections for these small, enigmatic planets.},

As alpine rock types are characterized by crack-dominated porosity and high rock strength, frost cracking observations from low strength and grain supported pore-space rocks cannot be transferred. Here, we conducted laboratory experiments on Wetterstein limestone samples with different initial crack density and saturation to test their influence on frost cracking efficacy. We exposed rocks to real-rockwall freezing conditions and monitored acoustic emissions as a proxy for cracking. To differentiate triggers of observed cracking, we modeled ice pressure and thermal stresses. Our results show initial full saturation is not a singular prerequisite for frost cracking. We also observe higher cracking rates in less-fractured rock. Finally, we find that the temperature threshold for frost cracking in alpine rocks falls below -7{$^\circ$}C. Thus, colder, north-exposed rock faces in the Alps likely experience more frost cracking than southern-facing counterparts.},

However, the technique has not been evaluated on multiplanet systems. We use the TRAPPIST-1 system as our test bed to evaluate PIE's ability to resolve multiple planets. We follow the unfolding discoveries in the TRAPPIST-1 system and examine the results from the PIE technique at every stage. We test the information gained from observations with JWST and next-generation infrared observatories like the proposed MIRECLE mission concept. We find that even in the case where only the star is known, the PIE technique would infer the presence of multiple planets in the system. The precise number inferred is dependent on the wavelength range of the observation and the noise level of the data. We also find that in such a tightly packed, multiplanet system such as TRAPPIST-1, the PIE technique struggles to constrain the semi-major axis beyond prior knowledge. Despite these drawbacks and the fact that JWST is less sensitive to the fluxes from planets g and h, with strong priors in their orbital parameters we are able to constrain their equilibrium temperatures. We conclude that the PIE technique may enable the discovery of unknown exoplanets around solar-neighborhood M dwarfs and could characterize known planets around them.},

  abstract = {The presence of H2O within differentiated terrestrial bodies in the inner Solar System is well established; however, the source(s) of this H2O and the time of its arrival to the inner Solar System is an area of active study. At present, the prevailing model for the origin of inner Solar System H2O calls upon carbonaceous chondrites as the source. This is largely based on reported observations that H- and N-isotopic compositions of differentiated planetary bodies are largely the same and within a range of values that overlaps with carbonaceous chondrites as opposed to comets or the Sun. In this contribution, we evaluate the efficacy of this model and other models for the origin of inner Solar System H2O by considering geochronological constraints on early Solar System history, constraints on primary building blocks of differentiated bodies based on nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies, and constraints from dynamical models of planet formation. In addition to H- and N-isotopic data, these constraints indicate that an interstellar source of H2O was present in the inner Solar System within the first 4 Ma of CAI formation. Furthermore, the most H2O-rich carbonaceous chondrites are unlikely to be the source of H2O for the earliest-formed differentiated bodies based on their minimally overlapping primary accretion windows and the separation of their respective isotopic reservoirs by Jupiter in the timespan of about 1--4 Ma after CAI formation. The presence of deuterium-rich, non-nebular H2O sources in the inner Solar System prior to the formation of carbonaceous chondrites or comets implies early contributions of interstellar ices to both the inner and outer Solar System portions of the protoplanetary disk. Evidence for this interstellar ice component in the inner Solar System may be preserved in LL chondrites and in the mantle of Mars. In contrast to the earlier-formed bodies within the inner Solar System, Earth's protracted accretion window may have facilitated incorporation of H2O in its interior from both the inner and outer Solar System, helping the Earth to become a habitable planet.},

We search the TESS light curves for transiting planets with orbital periods below 7 days and recover all six known planets within the sample, as well as a likely planet candidate orbiting LHS 475. Each of these planets is consistent with a terrestrial composition, with planet radii between 0.91 and 1.31 R {$\oplus$}. We characterize the transit detection sensitivity for each star as a function of planet radius, insolation, and orbital period. We obtain a cumulative occurrence rate of terrestrial planets per star with radii above 0.5 R {$\oplus$} and orbital periods between 0.4 and 7 days. We find that for comparable insolations, planets larger than 1.5 R {$\oplus$} (sub-Neptunes) are significantly less abundant around mid-to-late M dwarfs compared to earlier-type stars, while the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets is comparable to that of more massive M dwarfs. We estimate that overall, terrestrials outnumber sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs by 14 to 1, in contrast to GK dwarfs, where they are roughly equinumerous. We place a 1{$\sigma$} upper limit of 0.07 planets larger than 1.5 R {$\oplus$} per star within the orbital period range of 0.5--7 days.

  abstract = {We re-determine planetary occurrences around M dwarfs using 20 years of observations from HARPS on 197 targets. The first aim of this study is to propose more precise occurrence rates using the large volume of the sample but also variations to previous calculations, particularly by considering multiplicity, which is now an integral part of planetary occurrence calculations. The second aim is to exploit the extreme longevity of HARPS to determine occurrence rates in the unexplored domain of very long periods. This work relies entirely on the 197 radial velocity time series obtained and analysed in our previous study. By considering they are cleaned of any detectable signal, we convert them into detection limits. We use these 197 limits to produce a detectability map and combine it with confirmed planet detections to establish our occurrence rates. Finally, we also convert the detection limits from orbital period to insolation in order to construct an occurrence statistics for the temperate zone. We find a strong prevalence of low-mass planets around M dwarfs, with an occurrence rate of 120\% for planets with a mass between 0.75 and 3 Me. In addition, we compute an occurrence rate of 45.3\% +20-16\% for temperate zone planets around M dwarfs. We obtain an occurrence rate of a few percent for giant planets with wide separations. In our sample these giant planets with wide separations are only detected around the most massive M dwarfs.},

We are at a unique time to study these planets. The missions Juno to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn have provided invaluable information to reveal their interiors like never before, including extremely accurate gravity data, atmospheric abundances and magnetic field measurements that revolutionised our knowledge of their interior structures. At the same time, new laboratory experiments and modelling efforts also improved, and statistical analysis of these planets is now possible to explore all the different conditions that shape their interiors. We review the interior structure of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, including the need for inhomogeneous structures to explain the data, the problems unsolved and the effect that advances in our understanding of their internal structure have on their formation and evolution.},

The number of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently too small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of the search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler field. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets' existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without confirmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are strong candidates for follow-up radial velocity confirmation and characterization. Once confirmed, the atmospheric information content in the phase curves may be studied in yet greater detail.},

  abstract = {The widespread prevalence of close-in, nearly coplanar super-Earth- and sub-Neptune-sized planets in multiple-planet systems was one of the most surprising results from the Kepler mission. By studying a uniform sample of Kepler "multis" with mass measurements from transit timing variations (TTVs), we show that a given planetary system tends to harbor a characteristic type of planet. That is, planets in a system have both masses and radii that are far more similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the population. This finding has two important ramifications. First, the large intrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated by system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if provided enough properties of the star and primordial protoplanetary disk, there may be a substantial degree of predictability in the outcome of the planet formation process. We show that stellar mass and metallicity account for of order \$20{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ of the variation in outcomes; the remainder is as-yet unknown.},

Here we present evidence that the observed high-multiplicity Kepler systems truncate at smaller orbital periods than can be explained by geometric and detection biases alone. To show this, we considered the existence of hypothetical planets orbiting beyond the observed transiting planets with properties dictated by the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns of intra-system radius and period ratio uniformity. We evaluated the detectability of these hypothetical planets using (1) a novel approach for estimating the mutual inclination dispersion of multi-transiting systems based on transit chord length ratios and (2) a model of transit probability and detection efficiency that accounts for the impacts of planet multiplicity on completeness. Under the assumption that the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns continue to larger orbital separations than observed, we find that \${\textbackslash}gtrsim35{\textbackslash}\%\$ of Kepler compact multis should possess additional detected planets beyond the known planets, constituting a \${\textbackslash}sim7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ discrepancy with the lack of such detections. These results indicate that the outer (\${\textbackslash}sim100-300\$ days) regions of compact multis experience a truncation (i.e. an "edge-of-the-multis") or a significant breakdown of the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns, in the form of systematically smaller radii or larger period ratios. We outline future observations that can distinguish these possibilities, and we discuss implications for planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {The orbits of short-period exoplanets are sculpted by tidal dissipation. However, the mechanisms and associated efficiencies of these tidal interactions are poorly constrained. We present robust constraints on the tidal quality factors of short-period exoplanetary host stars through the usage of a novel empirical technique. The method is based on analyzing structures in the population-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time remaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides. Using simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we show that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution with an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly evident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet population. We use this to constrain both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the stellar tidal quality factor and show that it must decrease sharply with planetary orbital period. Specifically, with \$Q\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}' = Q\_0 (P/2 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{days\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, we find \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5.5\} {\textbackslash}lesssim Q\_0 {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ and \$-4.33 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}lesssim -2\$. Our results are most consistent with predictions from tidal resonance locking, in which the planets are locked into resonance with a tidally excited gravity mode in their host stars.},

Exoplanets within a system tend to be of similar size and mass, evenly spaced, and are often ordered in size and mass.

The size--mass similarity trends are primordial and originate from the oligarchic growth of protoplanetary embryos and the uniform growth of planets at early times.

  abstract = {We present a novel, model-independent framework for studying the architecture of an exoplanetary system at the system level. This framework allows us to characterise, quantify, and classify the architecture of an individual planetary system. Our aim in this endeavour is to generate a systematic method to study the arrangement and distribution of various planetary quantities within a single planetary system. We propose that the space of planetary system architectures be partitioned into four classes: similar, mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered. We applied our framework to observed and synthetic multi-planetary systems, thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density, core mass, and the core water mass fraction. We explored the relationships between a system's (mass) architecture and other properties. Our work suggests that: (a) similar architectures are the most common outcome of planet formation; (b) internal structure and composition of planets shows a strong link with their system architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass architecture from their core mass architecture; (d) most planets that started inside the ice line and formed in-situ are found in systems with a similar architecture; and (e) most anti-ordered systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most observed mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry planets. We find, in good agreement with theory, that observations are generally biased towards the discovery of systems whose density architectures are similar, mixed, or anti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter spaces for understanding theory and observations. Future studies may utilise our framework to not only constrain the knowledge of individual planets, but also the multi-faceted architecture of an entire planetary system. We also speculate on the role of system architectures in hosting habitable worlds.},

  abstract = {In the first paper of this series, we proposed a model-independent framework for characterising the architecture of planetary systems at the system level. There are four classes of planetary system architecture: similar, mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered. In this paper, we investigate the formation pathways leading to these four architecture classes. To understand the role of nature versus nurture in sculpting the final (mass) architecture of a system, we apply our architecture framework to synthetic planetary systems -- formed via core-accretion -- using the Bern model. General patterns emerge in the formation pathways of the four architecture classes. Almost all planetary systems emerging from protoplanetary disks whose initial solid mass was less than one Jupiter mass are similar. Systems emerging from heavier disks may become mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. Increasing dynamical interactions (planet-planet, planet-disk) tends to shift a system's architecture from mixed to anti-ordered to ordered. Our model predicts the existence of a new metallicity-architecture correlation. Similar systems have very high occurrence around low-metallicity stars. The occurrence of the anti-ordered and ordered classes increases with increasing metallicity. The occurrence of mixed architecture first increases and then decreases with increasing metallicity. In our synthetic planetary systems, the role of nature is disentangled from the role of nurture. Nature (or initial conditions) pre-determines whether the architecture of a system becomes similar; otherwise nurture influences whether a system becomes mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. We propose the `Aryabhata formation scenario' to explain some planetary systems which host only water-rich worlds. We finish this paper with a discussion of future observational and theoretical works that may support or refute the results of this paper.},

By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 {\textpm} 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter and close Neptune occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 {\textpm} 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. Additionally, about half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets towards low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction.},

  abstract = {The ubiquity of Earth- to super-Earth-sized planets found very close to their host stars has motivated in situ formation models. In particular, inside-out planet formation is a scenario in which planets coalesce sequentially in the disk, at the local gas pressure maximum near the inner boundary of the dead zone. The pressure maximum arises from a decline in viscosity, going from the active innermost disk (where thermal ionization yields high viscosities via the magnetorotational instability [MRI]) to the adjacent dead zone (where the MRI is quenched). Previous studies of the pressure maximum, based on {$\alpha$}-disk models, have assumed ad hoc values for the viscosity parameter {$\alpha$} in the active zone, ignoring the detailed MRI physics. Here we explicitly couple the MRI criteria to the {$\alpha$}-disk equations, to find steady-state solutions for the disk structure. We consider both Ohmic and ambipolar resistivities, a range of disk accretion rates (10-10--10-8 M{$\odot$} yr-1), stellar masses (0.1--1 M{$\odot$}), and fiducial values of the non-MRI {$\alpha$}-viscosity in the dead zone ({$\alpha$}DZ = 10-5 to 10-3). We find that (1) a midplane pressure maximum forms radially outside the dead zone inner boundary; (2) Hall resistivity dominates near the inner disk midplane, perhaps explaining why close-in planets do not form in {$\sim$}50\% of systems; (3) X-ray ionization can compete with thermal ionization in the inner disk, because of the low steady-state surface density there; and (4) our inner disks are viscously unstable to surface density perturbations.},

  abstract = {Constraining planet formation based on the atmospheric composition of exoplanets is a fundamental goal of the exoplanet community. Existing studies commonly try to constrain atmospheric abundances, or to analyze what abundance patterns a given description of planet formation predicts. However, there is also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances to planet formation for a given planet may be challenging, but a qualitative understanding of the effects of different formation models is possible, opening up pathways for new investigations.},

  abstract = {Cold super-Earths that retain their primordial, H--He-dominated atmosphere could have surfaces that are warm enough to host liquid water. This would be due to the collision-induced absorption of infrared light by hydrogen, which increases with pressure. However, the long-term potential for habitability of such planets has not been explored yet. Here we investigate the duration of this potential exotic habitability by simulating planets of different core masses, envelope masses and semi-major axes. We find that terrestrial and super-Earth planets with masses of {\textasciitilde}1--10\,M{$\oplus$} can maintain temperate surface conditions up to 5--8\,Gyr at radial distances larger than {\textasciitilde}2\,au. The required envelope masses are {\textasciitilde}10-4\,M{$\oplus$} (which is 2 orders of magnitude more massive than Earth's) but can be an order of magnitude smaller (when close-in) or larger (when far out). This result suggests that the concept of planetary habitability should be revisited and made more inclusive with respect to the classical definition.},

  abstract = {Planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets in the search for rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars' highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8-5.2 micron JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3x Earth's insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ and 3.0 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2 - 3.3 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H2O {$>$} 10\% to 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\_{\textbackslash}nu\$ = 1.0) to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

Given that the giant planets formed first in the protoplanetary disk, we stress the sensitive dependence of the terrestrial planet accretion process on the orbital architecture of the giant planets and on their evolution. This suggests a great diversity among the terrestrial planet populations in extrasolar systems.

  abstract = {We present a plausible and coherent view of the evolution of the protosolar disk that is consistent with the cosmochemical constraints and compatible with observations of other protoplanetary disks and sophisticated numerical simulations. The evidence that high-temperature condensates, CAIs and AOAs, formed near the protosun before being transported to the outer disk can be explained by either an early phase of vigorous radial spreading of the disk, or fast transport of these condensates from the vicinity of the protosun towards large disk radii via the protostellar outflow. The assumption that the material accreted towards the end of the infall phase was isotopically distinct allows us to explain the observed dichotomy in nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies of meteorites and leads to intriguing predictions on the isotopic composition of refractory elements in comets. When the infall of material waned, the disk started to evolve as an accretion disk. Initially, dust drifted inwards, shrinking the radius of the dust component to {\textasciitilde} 45 au, probably about 1/2 of the width of the gas component. Then structures must have emerged, producing a series of pressure maxima in the disk which trapped the dust on My timescales. This allowed planetesimals to form at radically distinct times without changing significantly of isotopic properties. There was no late accretion of material onto the disk via streamers. The disk disappeared in {\textasciitilde}5 Myr, as indicated by paleomagnetic data in meteorites. In conclusion, the evolution of the protosolar disk seems to have been quite typical in terms of size, lifetime, and dust behavior, suggesting that the peculiarities of the Solar system with respect to extrasolar planetary system probably originate from the chaotic nature of planet formation and not at the level of the parental disk.},

  abstract = {Context. Observations have revealed in the Kepler data a depleted region separating smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes. This can be explained as an evaporation valley between planets with and without H/He that is caused by atmospheric escape. Aims. We want to analytically derive the valley's locus and understand how it depends on planetary properties and stellar X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity. We also want to derive constraints for planet formation models. Methods. First, we conducted numerical simulations of the evolution of close-in low-mass planets with H/He undergoing escape. We performed parameter studies with grids in core mass and orbital separation, and we varied the postformation H/He mass, the strength of evaporation, and the atmospheric and core composition. Second, we developed an analytical model for the valley locus. Results. We find that the bottom of the valley quantified by the radius of the largest stripped core, Rbare, at a given orbital distance depends only weakly on postformation H/He mass. The reason is that a high initial H/He mass means that more gas needs to evaporate, but also that the planet density is lower, increasing mass loss. Regarding the stellar XUV-luminosity, Rbare is found to scale as LXUV0.135. The same weak dependency applies to the efficiency factor {$\epsilon$} of energy-limited evaporation. As found numerically and analytically, Rbare varies a function of orbital period P for a constant {$\epsilon$} as P-2pc\${\textbackslash}backslash\$3 {$\approx$} P-0.18, where Mc Rcpc is the mass-radius relation of solid cores. We note that Rbare is about 1.7 RO at a ten-day orbital period for an Earth-like composition. Conclusions. The numerical results are explained very well with the analytical model where complete evaporation occurs if the temporal integral over the stellar XUV irradiation that is absorbed by the planet is larger than the binding energy of the envelope in the gravitational potential of the core. The weak dependency on the postformation H/He means that the valley does not strongly constrain gas accretion during formation. But the weak dependency on primordial H/He mass, stellar LXUV, and {$\epsilon$} could be the reason why the valley is so clearly visible observationally, and why various models find similar results theoretically. At the same time, given the large observed spread of LXUV, the dependency on it is still strong enough to explain why the valley is not completely empty.},

It is also an interdisciplinary bridge which links astronomy to geology and mineralogy. Recent observations of young stars accompanied by their protoplanetary disks (Manara et al. 2022) provide direct insights into the conditions at which planets are forming. These astronomical observations can be taken as initial conditions for the models of planet formation. In this chapter, we first give an brief overview of key observational constraints for planet formation theory derived from both the solar system and from the exoplanet population. We then review physical mechanisms governing planetary system formation and discuss how they can be put together to form global planet formation models. Finally, we discuss how the compositional links from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres put novel constraints on planet formation theory. In particular, we are currently gaining insights into the composition of the inner, planet-forming region within the disks thanks to observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (Grant et al. 2023; Perotti et al. 2023). The task for planet formation modelling is then to link these observational properties and compositional content to the physical properties, and also the elementary inventory of meteorites, the Moon, Earth, and the other planets. If successful, this global approach can provide useful constraints for geological studies.},

As was pointed out some years ago1, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight---the prerequisites for photosynthesis---are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds. Since then, good additional evidence has been provided that the clouds are composed of ice crystals at their tops2,3, and it seems likely that there are water droplets toward their bottoms4. Independent evidence for water vapour also exists5. The temperature at the cloud tops is about 210{$^\circ$} K, and at the cloud bottoms is probably at least 260--280{$^\circ$} K (refs. 4 and 6). Atmospheric pressure at this temperature level is about 1 atm.7. The observed planetary albedo falls steeply in the violet and ultra-violet8, which accounts for the pale lemon yellow colour of Venus. The albedo decline would not be expected for pure ice particles, and must therefore be caused by some contaminant. Dust, ozone, C3O2 and other gases may possibly explain these data but, whatever the explanation, the ultra-violet flux below the clouds is likely to be low. If small amounts of minerals are stirred up to the clouds from the surface, it is by no means difficult to imagine an indigenous biology in the clouds of Venus. What follows is one such speculation.},

Smaller planets are sufficiently dense to be rocky, but those with radii larger than {$\sim$}1.6 are thought to display in many cases hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes up to {$\sim$}30\% of the planetary mass. These low-mass planets are highly irradiated and the question of their origin, evolution, and possible links remains open. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by the greenhouse effect display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inflated atmospheres without invoking the presence of large hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes. We present a new set of mass--radius relationships for ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, which are found to be well adapted to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and water-rich sub-Neptunes could belong to the same family of planets, i.e., hydrogen/helium-free planets, with differences between their interiors simply resulting from the variation in the water content.},

  abstract = {The Kepler spacecraft has discovered a large number of planets with up to one-year periods and down to terrestrial sizes. While the majority of the target stars are main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with effective temperatures as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These cooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone, yet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK stars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of different spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the star and show that they are significantly different from each other. We further identify two trends. First, the occurrence of Earth- to Neptune-sized planets (1--4 R{$\oplus$}) is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital periods probed by Kepler; planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as around G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in planet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a {$\sim$}10 day orbital period, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median stellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is stellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of stellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping, and destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the pre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of migrating planets or planetary building blocks close to the star. These results demonstrate the stellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence rate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the inner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration of planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.},

  abstract = {The water-ice or snow line is one of the key properties of protoplanetary disks that determines the water content of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass accretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in the disk. We calculate the snow-line location from recent observations of mass accretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial disk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow-line locations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow-line locations of {$\sim$}0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the 1{$\sigma$} snow-line location among solar-mass stars of the same age ranges from {$\sim$}2 to {$\sim$}5 AU. For more realistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located up to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of N-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial planets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion in snow-line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like dust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around Sun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of low-mass M stars ( 0.5 \{M\}{$\odot$} ) as in previous works. The closer-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the habitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars. Considering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host most of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are able to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.},

  abstract = {Host star metallicity provides a measure of the conditions in protoplanetary disks at the time of planet formation. Using a sample of over 20,000 Kepler stars with spectroscopic metallicities from the LAMOST survey, we explore how the exoplanet population depends on host star metallicity as a function of orbital period and planet size. We find that exoplanets with orbital periods less than 10 days are preferentially found around metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {$\simeq$} 0.15 {\textpm} 0.05 dex). The occurrence rates of these hot exoplanets increases to {$\sim$}30\% for super-solar metallicity stars from {$\sim$}10\% for stars with a sub-solar metallicity. Cooler exoplanets, which reside at longer orbital periods and constitute the bulk of the exoplanet population with an occurrence rate of {$\greaterequivlnt$}90\%, have host star metallicities consistent with solar. At short orbital periods, days, the difference in host star metallicity is largest for hot rocky planets (), where the metallicity difference is [Fe/H] {$\simeq$} 0.25 {\textpm} 0.07 dex. The excess of hot rocky planets around metal-rich stars implies they either share a formation mechanism with hot Jupiters, or trace a planet trap at the protoplanetary disk inner edge, which is metallicity dependent. We do not find statistically significant evidence for a previously identified trend that small planets toward the habitable zone are preferentially found around low-metallicity stars. Refuting or confirming this trend requires a larger sample of spectroscopic metallicities.},

  abstract = {The Kepler survey provides a statistical census of planetary systems out to the habitable zone. Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of eta\_earth=36+-14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than {$\sim$}8\% and {$\sim$}3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

  abstract = {We propose a planet formation scenario to explain the elevated occurrence rates of transiting planets around M dwarfs compared to Sun-like stars discovered by Kepler. We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 M {$\odot$} and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anticorrelated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial-velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the substellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

However, dust mass measurements of Class II disks with ALMA have called into question whether they contain enough solids to build the exoplanets that have been detected to date. In this paper, we calculate the mass and spatial scale of solid material around Sun-like stars probed by transit and radial velocity exoplanet surveys, and compare those to the observed dust masses and sizes of Class II disks in the same stellar mass regime. We show that the apparent mass discrepancy disappears when accounting for observational selection and detection biases. We find a discrepancy only when the planet formation efficiency is below 100\%, or if there is a population of undetected exoplanets that significantly contributes to the mass in solids. We identify a positive correlation between the masses of planetary systems and their respective orbital periods, which is consistent with the trend between the masses and the outer radii of Class II dust disks. This implies that, despite a factor 100 difference in spatial scale, the properties of protoplanetary disks seem to be imprinted on the exoplanet population.}

  abstract = {All cells contain much more potassium, phosphate, and transition metals than modern (or reconstructed primeval) oceans, lakes, or rivers. Cells maintain ion gradients by using sophisticated, energy-dependent membrane enzymes (membrane pumps) that are embedded in elaborate ion-tight membranes. The first cells could possess neither ion-tight membranes nor membrane pumps, so the concentrations of small inorganic molecules and ions within protocells and in their environment would equilibrate. Hence, the ion composition of modern cells might reflect the inorganic ion composition of the habitats of protocells. We attempted to reconstruct the ``hatcheries'' of the first cells by combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. These ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and phosphate. Thus, protocells must have evolved in habitats with a high K+/Na+ ratio and relatively high concentrations of Zn, Mn, and phosphorous compounds. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of inland geothermal systems. Under the anoxic, CO2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of basins at geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. The precellular stages of evolution might have transpired in shallow ponds of condensed and cooled geothermal vapor that were lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K+, Zn2+, and phosphorous compounds.},

  abstract = {The characterisation of giant exoplanets is crucial to constrain giant planet formation and evolution theory and for putting the solar-system's giant planets in perspective. Typically, mass-radius (M-R) measurements of moderately irradiated warm Jupiters are used to estimate the planetary bulk composition, which is an essential quantity for constraining giant planet formation, evolution and structure models. The successful launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming ARIEL mission open a new era in giant exoplanet characterisation as atmospheric measurements provide key information on the composition and internal structure of giant exoplanets. In this review, we discuss how giant planet evolution models are used to infer the planetary bulk composition, and the connection between the compositions of the interior and atmosphere. We identify the important theoretical uncertainties in evolution models including the equations of state, atmospheric models, chemical composition, interior structure and main energy transport processes. Nevertheless, we show that that atmospheric measurements by JWST and ARIEL and the accurate determination of stellar ages by PLATO can significantly reduce the degeneracy in the inferred bulk composition. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of evolution models for the characterisation of direct-imaged planets. We conclude that giant planet theory has a critical role in the interpretation of observation and emphasise the importance of advancing giant planet theory.},

In addition the second model fits all other aspects of the radius distribution, including the signal-to-noise distribution of the observed planets.

Given our current instrumentation and detection biases, M dwarfs are prime targets to search for small planets that are in (or nearby) the habitable zone of their host star.

A transmission spectrum combines contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, but these limbs may have different temperatures, compositions, and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. High-resolution ground-based observations have detected limb asymmetry on several ultra-hot ({$>$}2000 K) exoplanets, but space-based investigation into limb asymmetry is in its infancy, and limb asymmetry's prevalence in the broader exoplanet population remains unexplored. We find evidence for limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107b via transmission spectroscopy from 2.5 to 4.0 micrometers with JWST/NIRCam. This is one of the first low-resolution space-based measurements of limb asymmetry and is unique because, at 770 K, WASP-107b is in a relatively cool regime where planetary terminators are expected to be homogeneous. These observations imply a difference in temperature and cloud properties between WASP-107b's limbs, challenging our models of limb asymmetry in this cooler regime.},

  abstract = {SPECULOOS-South, an observatory composed of four independent 1-m robotic telescopes, located at ESO Paranal, Chile, started scientific operation in 2019 January. This Southern hemisphere facility operates as part of the Search for Habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars (SPECULOOS), an international network of 1-m-class telescopes surveying for transiting terrestrial planets around the nearest and brightest ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). To automatically and efficiently process the observations of SPECULOOS-South, and to deal with the specialized photometric requirements of UCD targets, we present our automatic pipeline. This pipeline includes an algorithm for automated differential photometry and an extensive correction technique for the effects of telluric water vapour, using ground measurements of the precipitable water vapour. Observing very red targets in the near-infrared can result in photometric systematics in the differential light curves, related to the temporally-varying, wavelength-dependent opacity of the Earth's atmosphere. These systematics are sufficient to affect the daily quality of the light curves, the longer time-scale variability study of our targets and even mimic transit-like signals. Here we present the implementation and impact of our water vapour correction method. Using the 179 nights and 98 targets observed in the I + z{$\prime$} filter by SPECULOOS-South since 2019 January, we show the impressive photometric performance of the facility (with a median precision of {$\sim$}1.5\,mmag for 30-min binning of the raw, non-detrended light curves) and assess its detection potential. We compare simultaneous observations with SPECULOOS-South and TESS, to show that we readily achieve high-precision, space-level photometry for bright, UCDs, highlighting SPECULOOS-South as the first facility of its kind.},

  abstract = {The similar orbital distances and detection rates of debris disks and the prominent rings observed in protoplanetary disks suggest a potential connection between these structures. We explore this connection with new calculations that follow the evolution of rings of pebbles and planetesimals as they grow into planets and generate dusty debris. Depending on the initial solid mass and planetesimal formation efficiency, the calculations predict diverse outcomes for the resulting planet masses and accompanying debris signature. When compared with debris disk incidence rates as a function of luminosity and time, the model results indicate that the known population of bright cold debris disks can be explained by rings of solids with the (high) initial masses inferred for protoplanetary disk rings and modest planetesimal formation efficiencies that are consistent with current theories of planetesimal formation. These results support the possibility that large protoplanetary disk rings evolve into the known cold debris disks. The inferred strong evolutionary connection between protoplanetary disks with large rings and mature stars with cold debris disks implies that the remaining majority population of low-mass stars with compact protoplanetary disks leaves behind only modest masses of residual solids at large radii and evolves primarily into mature stars without detectable debris beyond 30 au. The approach outlined here illustrates how combining observations with detailed evolutionary models of solids strongly constrains the global evolution of disk solids and underlying physical parameters such as the efficiency of planetesimal formation and the possible existence of invisible reservoirs of solids in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {Abstract A simple one-dimensional radiative--convective equilibrium model is used to investigate the relationship between the surface temperature and the outgoing infrared radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The model atmosphere has a gray infrared absorption coefficient and is composed of a radiative equilibrium stratosphere and a moist adiabat troposphere. An upper limit of the outgoing infrared radiation is found to exist. The existence of the upper limit is characterized by the radiation limits that appear when the optical depth of the entire atmosphere becomes sufficiently deep and the temperature structure around the levels where the optical depth is about unity approaches a fixed profile. This appearance of an upper limit differs from that found by Komabayashi and Ingersoll, which is obtained from the constraint of the stratospheric radiation balance. As one of those radiation limits, the outgoing infrared radiation has an asymptotic limit as the surface temperature increases. This is caused by the tropospheric structure approaching the water vapor saturation curve. It is considered that the asymptotic limits appearing in the radiatively and thermodynamically more complicated models utilized by Abe and Matsui and Kasting are corresponding to this asymptotic limit indicated in our model.},

  abstract = {Neptune-sized planets exhibit a wide range of compositions and densities, depending on factors related to their formation and evolution history, such as the distance from their host stars and atmospheric escape processes. They can vary from relatively low-density planets with thick hydrogen--helium atmospheres1,2 to higher-density planets with a substantial amount of water or a rocky interior with a thinner atmosphere, such as HD\,95338\,b (ref.\,3), TOI-849\,b (ref.\,4) and TOI-2196\,b (ref.\,5). The discovery of exoplanets in the hot-Neptune desert6, a region close to the host stars with a deficit of Neptune-sized planets, provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including the existence of this region itself. Here we show observations of the transiting planet TOI-1853\,b, which has a radius of 3.46\,{\textpm}\,0.08 Earth radii and orbits a dwarf star every 1.24\,days. This planet has a mass of 73.2\,{\textpm}\,2.7 Earth masses, almost twice that of any other Neptune-sized planet known so far, and a density of 9.7\,{\textpm}\,0.8 grams per cubic centimetre. These values place TOI-1853\,b in the middle of the Neptunian desert and imply that heavy elements dominate its mass. The properties of TOI-1853\,b present a puzzle for conventional theories of planetary formation and evolution, and could be the result of several proto-planet collisions or the final state of an initially high-eccentricity planet that migrated closer to its parent star.},

  abstract = {Correlations between the occurrence rate of exoplanets and their host star properties provide important clues about the planet formation process. We studied the dependence of the observed properties of exoplanets (radius, mass, and orbital period) as a function of their host star metallicity. We analyzed the planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 Kepler candidates from the latest Kepler data release, DR25 (Q1--Q17), with revised planetary radii based on Gaia DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1--Q17 (DR25) stellar and planet catalog). With a much larger sample and improved radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the literature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses {$>$}4.0 MJ: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and the orbital period of the planet. We find that for planets with orbital periods less than 10 days, the average metallicity of the host star is higher than that for planets with periods greater than 10 days.},

The choice of the fields to be pointed at is a crucial task since it has a direct impact on the scientific return of the mission. In this paper, we describe and discuss the formal requirements and the key scientific prioritization criteria that have to be taken into account in the Long-duration Observation Phase (LOP) field selection, and apply a quantitative metric to guide us in this complex optimization process. We identify two provisional LOP fields, one for each hemisphere (LOPS1 and LOPN1), and we discuss their properties and stellar content. While additional fine-tuning shall be applied to LOP selection before the definitive choice, which is set to be made two years before launch, we expect that their position will not move by more than a few degrees with respect to what is proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] \$rsim\$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from \$0.55{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.10\}\$ for d to \$0.78{\textasciicircum}\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of \$0.87{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH\$\_\{4\}\$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at \${$>$}5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na\$\_\{2\}\$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.},

Liquid mirrors (LMs) may break this unfavorable cost scaling. When rotated at a constant angular velocity, it has been shown that fluid surfaces take the form of a paraboloid, which can function as a primary mirror. However, current LMs cannot slew or tilt off-zenith due to gravity, greatly limiting the viewing area in the sky. To overcome these limitations while also enabling low-cost, very-large-aperture telescopes, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched the Zenith program. Zenith is developing entirely new LM design-for-build approaches that can create large optical surfaces without rotation and maintain the optical quality during tilt and slew by correcting transient liquid surface aberrations in real time. The development of these new designs is being supported by multi-physics models, materials, surface and field controls, and structures. We discuss key and fundamental aspects of four new design and modeling approaches for this new class of LMs, and the software and simulation tools developed by the Zenith program to design tiltable and size-scalable liquid mirrors.},

We explore water worlds within the framework of a joint mass-radius-period distribution of planets fit to a sample of transiting Kepler exoplanets, a subset of which have radial velocity mass measurements. We employ hierarchical Bayesian modeling to create a range of ten mixture models that include multiple compositional subpopulations of exoplanets. We model these subpopulations - including planets with gaseous envelopes, evaporated rocky cores, evaporated icy cores, intrinsically rocky planets, and intrinsically icy planets - in different combinations in order to assess which combinations are most favored by the data. Using cross-validation, we evaluate the support for models that include planets with icy compositions compared to the support for models that do not, finding broad support for both. We find significant population-level degeneracies between subpopulations of water worlds and planets with primordial envelopes. Among models that include one or more icy-core subpopulations, we find a wide range for the fraction of planets with icy compositions, with a rough upper limit of 50\%. Improved datasets or alternative modeling approaches may better be able to distinguish between these subpopulations of planets.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of {$\sim$}100 km class low-inclination objects in the classical Kuiper Belt (KB) are binaries with comparable masses and a wide separation of components. A favored model for their formation is that they were captured during the coagulation growth of bodies in the early KB. However, recent studies have suggested that large, {$\greaterequivlnt$}100 km objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of locally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity. Here, we examine the possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the excess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a solitary object. We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward the formation of KB binaries with observed properties, and can explain wide systems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36. Notably, the gravitational collapse is capable of producing {$\sim$}100\% binary fraction for a wide range of the swarm's initial angular momentum values. The binary components have similar masses ({$\sim$}80\% have a secondary-over-primary radius ratio {$>$}0.7) and their separation ranges from {$\sim$}1000 to {$\sim$}100,000 km. The binary orbits have eccentricities from e = 0 to {$\sim$}1, with the majority having e {$<$} 0.6. The binary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the swarm range from i = 0 to {$\sim$}90{$^\circ$}, with most cases having i {$<$} 50{$^\circ$}. The total binary mass represents a characteristic fraction of the collapsing swarm's total initial mass, Mtot, suggesting Mtot equivalent to that of a radius {$\sim$}100--250 km compact object. Our binary formation mechanism also implies that the primary and secondary components in each binary pair should have identical bulk composition, which is consistent with the current photometric data. We discuss the applicability of our results to the Pluto--Charon, Orcus--Vanth, (617) Patroclus--Menoetius, and (90) Antiope binary systems.},

This effect is particularly of concern for M dwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile rotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in order to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main sequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 (M4V--M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a fundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially habitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods reached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary habitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 (M6V--M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets via radial velocities.},

We present the discovery of the young planetary system TOI 451 (TIC 257605131, Gaia DR2 4844691297067063424). TOI 451 is a member of the 120 Myr old Pisces--Eridanus stream (Psc--Eri). We confirm membership in the stream with its kinematics, its lithium abundance, and the rotation and UV excesses of both TOI 451 and its wide-binary companion, TOI 451 B (itself likely an M-dwarf binary). We identified three candidate planets transiting in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data and followed up the signals with photometry from Spitzer and ground-based telescopes. The system comprises three validated planets at periods of 1.9, 9.2, and 16 days, with radii of 1.9, 3.1, and 4.1 R{$\bigotimes$}, respectively. The host star is near-solar mass with V = 11.0 and H = 9.3 and displays an infrared excess indicative of a debris disk. The planets offer excellent prospects for transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, providing the opportunity to study planetary atmospheres that may still be in the process of evolving.},

However, there is surprisingly little training in graduate school on how to develop this essential skill [Zimmerman et al., 2011] or discussion of best practices to ensure that reviewers at all levels efficiently provide the most useful review. Even more challenging for the novice peer reviewer is that journals also vary widely in their review guidelines. Nonetheless, the goals of peer review are crystal clear: to ensure the accuracy and improve the quality of published literature through constructive criticism. To make the peer review process as efficient and productive as possible, you may want to consider a few useful approaches to tackling major steps throughout your review, from contemplating a review request and reading and assessing the manuscript to writing the review and interacting with the journal's editors (see Figure 1). These tips are particularly relevant for graduate students or other first-time reviewers, but they may also be useful to experienced reviewers and to journal editors seeking to enhance their publication's processes.},

Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O- or H2-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.},

  abstract = {The magma ocean (MO) is a crucial stage in the build-up of terrestrial planets. Its solidification and the accompanying outgassing of volatiles set the conditions for important processes occurring later or even simultaneously, such as solid-state mantle convection and atmospheric escape. To constrain the duration of a global-scale Earth MO, we have built and applied a 1D interior model coupled with either a gray H2O/CO2 atmosphere or with a pure H2O atmosphere treated with a line-by-line model described in a companion paper by Katyal et al. We study in detail the effects of several factors affecting the MO lifetime, such as the initial abundance of H2O and CO2, the convection regime, the viscosity, the mantle melting temperature, and the longwave radiation absorption from the atmosphere. In this specifically multivariable system, we assess the impact of each factor with respect to a reference setting commonly assumed in the literature. We find that the MO stage can last from a few thousand to several million years. By coupling the interior model with the line-by-line atmosphere model, we identify the conditions that determine whether the planet experiences a transient MO or it ceases to cool and maintains a continuous MO. We find a simultaneous dependence of this distinction on the mass of the outgassed H2O atmosphere and on the MO surface melting temperature. We discuss their combined impact on the MO's lifetime in addition to the known dependence on albedo, orbital distance, and stellar luminosity, and we note observational degeneracies that arise thereby for target exoplanets.},

However, lack of knowledge on the state of matter in  H 2 H2 O-rich setting at high pressures and temperatures ( {$P-T$} P-T ) places important limitations on our understanding of this planet type. We have conducted experiments for reactions between  SiO 2 SiO2  and  H 2 H2 O as archetypal materials for rock and ice, respectively, at high  {$P-T$} P-T . We found anomalously expanded volumes of dense silica (up to 4\%) recovered from hydrothermal synthesis above  {$\sim$} {$\sim$} 24 GPa where the  CaCl 2 CaCl2 -type (Ct) structure appears at lower pressures than in the anhydrous system. Infrared spectroscopy identified strong OH modes from the dense silica samples. Both previous experiments and our density functional theory calculations support up to 0.48 hydrogen atoms per formula unit of ( Si 1-{$x$} H 4{$x$} Si1-xH4x ) O 2 ({$x$}=0.12) O2\,(x=0.12) . At pressures above 60 GPa,  H 2 H2 O further changes the structural behavior of silica, stabilizing a niccolite-type structure, which is unquenchable. From unit-cell volume and phase equilibrium considerations, we infer that the niccolite-type phase may contain H with an amount at least comparable with or higher than that of the Ct phase. Our results suggest that the phases containing both hydrogen and lithophile elements could be the dominant materials in the interiors of water-rich planets. Even for fully layered cases, the large mutual solubility could make the boundary between rock and ice layers fuzzy. Therefore, the physical properties of the new phases that we report here would be important for understanding dynamics, geochemical cycle, and dynamo generation in water-rich planets.},

In the search for life-friendly worlds, water-rich planets therefore are obvious candidates and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The surface H2O layer on such planets (containing a liquid water ocean and possibly high-pressure ice below a specific depth) could potentially be hundreds of kilometres deep depending on the water content and the evolution of the proto-atmosphere. We study possible constraints for the habitability of deep water layers and introduce a new habitability classification relevant for water-rich planets (from Mars-size to super-Earth-size planets). A new ocean model has been developed that is coupled to a thermal evolution model of the mantle and core. Our interior structure model takes into account depth-dependent thermodynamic properties and the possible formation of high-pressure ice. We find that heat flowing out of the silicate mantle can melt an ice layer from below (in some cases episodically), depending mainly on the thickness of the ocean-ice shell, the mass of the planet, the surface temperature and the interior parameters (e.g. radioactive mantle heat sources). The high pressure at the bottom of deep water--ice layers could also impede volcanism at the water--mantle boundary for both stagnant lid and plate tectonics silicate shells. We conclude that water-rich planets with a deep ocean, a large planet mass, a high average density or a low surface temperature are likely less habitable than planets with an Earth-like ocean.},

  abstract = {Rocky exoplanets are typically classified as potentially habitable planets, if liquid water exists at the surface. The latter depends on several factors like the abundance of water but also on the amount of available solar energy and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere for a sufficiently long time for life to evolve. The range of distances to the star, where surface water might exist, is called the habitable zone. Here we study the effect of the planet interior of stagnant-lid planets on the formation of a secondary atmosphere through outgassing that would be needed to preserve surface water. We find that volcanic activity and associated outgassing in one-plate planets is strongly reduced after the magma ocean outgassing phase for Earth-like mantle compositions, if their mass and/or core-mass fraction exceeds a critical value. As a consequence, the effective outer boundary of the habitable zone is then closer to the host star than suggested by the classical habitable zone definition, setting an important restriction to the possible surface habitability of massive rocky exoplanets, assuming that they did not keep a substantial amount of their primary atmosphere and that they are not in the plate tectonics regime.},

Simple mass-radius relationships have been developed for scaled-up versions of Earth or other planetary bodies such as Mercury and Ganymede, as well as for one-material spheres made of pure water(-ice), silicates, or iron. However, they do not allow a thorough investigation of composition influences and thermal state on a planet's interior structure and properties. Aims: In this work, we investigate the structure of a rocky planet shortly after formation and at later stages of thermal evolution assuming the planet is differentiated into a metal core and a rocky mantle (consisting of Earth-like minerals, but with a variable iron content). Methods: We derived possible initial temperature profiles after the accretion and magma ocean solidification. We then developed parameterisations for the thermodynamic properties inside the core depending on planet mass, composition, and thermal state. Results: We provide the community with robust scaling laws for the interior structure, temperature profiles, and core- and mantle-averaged thermodynamic properties for planets composed of Earth's main minerals but with variable compositions of iron and silicates. Conclusions: The scaling laws make it possible to investigate variations in thermodynamic properties for different interior thermal states in a multitude of applications such as deriving mass-radius scaling laws or estimating magnetic field evolution and core crystallisation for rocky exoplanets.},

Here, we announce the discovery and validation of two planets found in that survey, Wendelstein-1b and Wendelstein-2b, which are two short-period hot Jupiters that orbit late K host stars.

Observational advances over the last decade have enabled high-resolution, interferometric studies of forming multiple systems, statistical surveys of multiplicity in star-forming regions, and new insights into disk evolution and planetary architectures in these systems. In this review, we compile the results of observational and theoretical studies of stellar multiplicity. We summarize the population statistics spanning system evolution from the protostellar phase through the main-sequence phase and evaluate the influence of the local environment. We describe current models for the origin of stellar multiplicity and review the landscape of numerical simulations and assess their consistency with observations. We review the properties of disks and discuss the impact of multiplicity on planet formation and system architectures. Finally, we summarize open questions and discuss the technical requirements for future observational and theoretical progress.},

  abstract = {Context: The long-term carbonate-silicate cycle plays an important role in the evolution of Earth's climate and, therefore, may also be an important mechanism in the evolution of the climates of Earth-like exoplanets. Aims: We investigate the effects of radiogenic mantle heating, core size, and planetary mass on the evolution of the atmospheric partial \$CO\_2\$ pressure, and the ability of a long-term carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects carbon cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled to the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the global Rayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure with time, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher abundances of radioactive isotopes result in higher \$CO\_2\$ pressures. We find a decreasing Rayleigh number and plate speed toward planets with larger core mass fractions \$f\_c\$, which leads to lower atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. More massive planets may favor the development of more \$CO\_2\$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors. Conclusions: The dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a significant effect on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Carbon cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating planetary climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances, planet masses and core sizes. More efficient carbon cycling on planets with a high mantle abundance of thorium or uranium highlights the importance of mapping the abundances of these elements in host stars of potentially habitable exoplanets. Inefficient carbon recycling on planets with a large core mass fraction (\$f\_c{\textbackslash}backslashgtrsim 0.8\$) emphasizes the importance of precise mass-radius measurements of Earth-sized exoplanets.},

The oxidation state of rocky interiors affects the volatile partitioning during mantle melting and subsequent volatile speciation near the surface. Here we show that the mantle redox state is central to the chemical composition of atmospheres while factors such as planetary mass, thermal state, and age mainly affect the degassing rate. We further demonstrate that mantle oxygen fugacity has an effect on atmospheric thickness and that volcanic degassing is most efficient for planets between 2 and 4 Earth masses. We show that outgassing of reduced systems is dominated by strongly reduced gases such as H2?, with only smaller fractions of moderately reduced/oxidised gases (CO?, H2O ?). Overall, a reducing scenario leads to a lower atmospheric pressure at the surface and to a larger atmospheric thickness compared to an oxidised system. Atmosphere predictions based on interior redox scenarios can be compared to observations of atmospheres of rocky exoplanets, potentially broadening our knowledge on the diversity of exoplanetary redox states.},

  abstract = {To date, thousands of planets have been discovered, but there are regions of the orbital parameter space that are still bare. An example is the short period and intermediate mass/radius space known as the Neptunian desert, where planets should be easy to find but discoveries remain few. This suggests unusual formation and evolution processes are responsible for the planets residing here. We present the discovery of TOI-332 b, a planet with an ultra-short period of \$0.78\$ d that sits firmly within the desert. It orbits a K0 dwarf with an effective temperature of \$5251 {\textbackslash}pm 71\$ K. TOI-332 b has a radius of \$3.20{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.12\}\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, smaller than that of Neptune, but an unusually large mass of \$57.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.6\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. It has one of the highest densities of any Neptune-sized planet discovered thus far at \$9.6{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.3\}\$ gcm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. A 4-layer internal structure model indicates it likely has a negligible hydrogen-helium envelope, something only found for a small handful of planets this massive, and so TOI-332 b presents an interesting challenge to planetary formation theories. We find that photoevaporation cannot account for the mass loss required to strip this planet of the Jupiter-like envelope it would have been expected to accrete. We need to look towards other scenarios, such as high-eccentricity migration, giant impacts, or gap opening in the protoplanetary disc, to try and explain this unusual discovery.},

A statistical strategy for evaluating the evolutionary pathways of terrestrial planets lies in the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets, where the sample size provides sufficient means for determining required runaway greenhouse conditions. Observations of potential exoVenuses can help confirm hypotheses about Venus' past, as well as the occurrence rate of Venus-like planets in other systems. Additionally, the data from future Venus missions, such as DAVINCI, EnVision, and VERITAS, will provide valuable information regarding Venus, and the study of exoVenuses will be complimentary to these missions. To facilitate studies of exoVenus candidates, we provide a catalog of all confirmed terrestrial planets in the Venus Zone, including transiting and non-transiting cases, and quantify their potential for follow-up observations. We examine the demographics of the exoVenus population with relation to stellar and planetary properties, such as the planetary radius gap. We highlight specific high-priority exoVenus targets for follow-up observations including: TOI-2285 b, LTT 1445 A c, TOI-1266 c, LHS 1140 c, and L98-59 d. We also discuss follow-up observations that may yield further insight into the Venus/Earth divergence in atmospheric properties.},

Studying the different populations of exoplanets is important for understanding the demographics of the different planetary types, which can then be linked to planetary formation and evolution. We present an updated exoplanet catalogue based on reliable, robust, and, as much as possible accurate mass and radius measurements of transiting planets up to 120 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}. The resulting mass-radius (M-R) diagram shows two distinct populations, corresponding to rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets which overlap in both mass and radius. The rocky exoplanet population shows a relatively small density variability and ends at mass of {\textasciitilde}25 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, possibly indicating the maximum core mass that can be formed. We use the composition line of pure water to separate the two populations, and infer two new empirical M-R relations based on this data: \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} = (0.9 {\textpm} 0.06) \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{(3.45{\textpm}0.12){$<$}sup/{$>$} for the rocky population, and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} = (1.74 {\textpm} 0.38) \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{(1.58{\textpm}0.10){$<$}sup/{$>$} for the volatile-rich population.

  abstract = {Inspired by the Kepler mission's planet discoveries, we consider the thermal contraction of planets close to their parent star, under the influence of evaporation. The mass-loss rates are based on hydrodynamic models of evaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only low mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by evaporation, with evaporation being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes inward of {$\sim$}0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects, while evaporation is negligible for Jupiter-mass objects. Moreover, most of the evaporation occurs in the first 100 Myr of stars' lives when they are more chromospherically active. We construct a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses, envelope masses, orbital separations, and stellar spectral types, and compare this population with the sizes and densities measured for low-mass planets, both in the Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to conclude that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler planets. In fact, some 50\% of the Kepler planet candidates may have been significantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking correlations observed in these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the stars and a possible bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets around 2 R {$\oplus$}. Planets that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally smaller than this size, and those with lower X-ray exposures are typically larger. A bimodal planet size distribution is naturally predicted by the evaporation model, where, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can either hold on to hydrogen envelopes {$\sim$}0.5\%-1\% in mass or be stripped entirely. To quantitatively reproduce the observed features, we argue that not only do low-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores surrounded with hydrogen envelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M {$\oplus$} and the majority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses. {\copyright} 2013.

  abstract = {One of the main scientific goals of the TESS mission is the discovery of transiting small planets around the closest and brightest stars in the sky. Here, using data from the CARMENES, MAROON-X, and HIRES spectrographs together with TESS, we report the discovery and mass determination of aplanetary system around the M1.5 V star GJ 806 (TOI-4481). GJ 806 is a bright (\emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 10.8mag, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 7.3 mag) and nearby (\emph{d{$<$}i/{$>$} = 12 pc) M dwarf that hosts at least two planets. The innermost planet, GJ 806 b, is transiting and has an ultra-short orbital period of 0.93 d, a radius of 1.331 {\textpm} 0.023 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, a mass of 1.90 {\textpm} 0.17 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, a mean density of 4.40 {\textpm} 0.45 g cm\textsuperscript{-3{$<$}sup/{$>$}, and an equilibrium temperature of 940 {\textpm} 10 K. We detect a second, non-transiting, super-Earth planet in the system, GJ 806 c, with an orbital period of 6.6 d, a minimum mass of 5.80 {\textpm} 0.30 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, and an equilibrium temperature of 490 {\textpm} 5 K. The radial velocity data also shows evidence for a third periodicity at 13.6 d, although the current dataset does not provide sufficient evidence to unambiguously distinguish between a third super-Earth mass (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} sin \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} = 8.50 {\textpm} 0.45 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}) planet or stellar activity. Additionally, we report one transit observation of GJ 806 b taken with CARMENES in search of a possible extended atmosphere of H or He, but we can only place upper limits to its existence. This is not surprising as our evolutionary models support the idea that any possible primordial H/He atmosphere that GJ 806 b might have had would be long lost. However, the bulk density of GJ 806 b makes it likely that the planet hosts some type of volatile atmosphere. With transmission spectroscopy metrics (TSM) of 44 and emission spectroscopy metrics (ESM) of 24, GJ 806 b is to date the third-ranked terrestrial planet around an M dwarf suitable for transmission spectroscopy studies using JWST, and the most promising terrestrial planet for emission spectroscopy studies. GJ 806b is also an excellent target for the detection of radio emission via star-planet interactions.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {In the past decade the study of exoplanet atmospheres at high-spectral resolution, via transmission/emission spectroscopy and cross-correlation techniques for atomic/molecular mapping, has become a powerful and consolidated methodology. The current limitation is the signal-to-noise ratio during a planetary transit. This limitation will be overcome by ANDES, an optical and near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT. ANDES will be a powerful transformational instrument for exoplanet science. It will enable the study of giant planet atmospheres, allowing not only an exquisite determination of atmospheric composition, but also the study of isotopic compositions, dynamics and weather patterns, mapping the planetary atmospheres and probing atmospheric formation and evolution models. The unprecedented angular resolution of ANDES, will also allow us to explore the initial conditions in which planets form in proto-planetary disks. The main science case of ANDES, however, is the study of small, rocky exoplanet atmospheres, including the potential for biomarker detections, and the ability to reach this science case is driving its instrumental design. Here we discuss our simulations and the observing strategies to achieve this specific science goal. Since ANDES will be operational at the same time as NASA's JWST and ESA's ARIEL missions, it will provide enormous synergies in the characterization of planetary atmospheres at high and low spectral resolution. Moreover, ANDES will be able to probe for the first time the atmospheres of several giant and small planets in reflected light. In particular, we show how ANDES will be able to unlock the reflected light atmospheric signal of a golden sample of nearby non-transiting habitable zone earth-sized planets within a few tenths of nights, a scientific objective that no other currently approved astronomical facility will be able to reach.},

  abstract = {The growing number of well-characterized exoplanets smaller than Neptune enables us to conduct more detailed population studies. We have updated the PlanetS catalog of transiting planets with precise and robust mass and radius measurements and use this comprehensive catalog to explore mass-radius (\emph{M--R{$<$}i/{$>$}) diagrams. On the one hand, we propose new \emph{M--R{$<$}i/{$>$} relationships to separate exoplanets into three populations: rocky planets, volatile-rich planets, and giant planets. On the other hand, we explore the transition in radius and density between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes around M-dwarfs and compare them with those orbiting K- and FG-dwarfs. Using Kernel density estimation method with a re-sampling technique, we estimated the normalized density and radius distributions, revealing connections between observations and theories on composition, internal structure, formation, and evolution of these exo-planets orbiting different spectral types. First, the substantial 30\% increase in the number of well-characterized exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs compared with previous studies shows us that there is no clear gap in either composition or radius between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. The ``water-worlds'' around M-dwarfs cannot correspond to a distinct population, their bulk density and equilibrium temperature can be interpreted by several different internal structures and compositions. The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. Moreover, we find that the transition between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different masses (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of super-Earths seems to be close to 10 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of sub-Neptunes increases with the star's mass, and is around 1.9 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, 3.4 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, and 4.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, for M-dwarfs, K-dwarfs, and FG-dwarfs, respectively. The precise value of this minimum mass may be affected by observational bias, but the trend appears to be reliable. This effect, attributed to planet migration, also contributes to the fading of the radius valley for M-planets compared to FGK-planets. While sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones (1.8 R\textsubscript{e{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 2.8 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}) exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs. Nonetheless, the sample of well-characterized small exoplanets remains limited, and each new discovery has the potential to reshape our understanding and interpretations of this population in the context of internal structure, composition, formation, and evolution models. Broader consensus is also needed for internal structure models and atmospheric compositions to enhance density interpretation and observable predictions for the atmospheres of these exoplanets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

The break in q for the microlensing planet population, which mostly probes the region outside the snowline, is {$\sim$}3--10 times higher than that inferred from Kepler. Thus, the most common planet inside the snowline is {$\sim$}3--10 times less massive than the one outside. With rocky planets interior to gaseous planets, the solar system broadly follows the combined mass-ratio function inferred from Kepler and microlensing. However, the exoplanet population has a less extreme radial distribution of planetary masses than the solar system.

Observations of young ({$<$}100 Myr) clusters can probe short-period sub-Neptunes that still retain most of their envelope mass.

The core accretion model predicts that giant planets cannot form around low-mass M dwarfs, although this idea has been challenged by recent planet discoveries. Here, we investigate the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass (0.1-0.3M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) M dwarfs. We monitor a volume-complete, inactive sample of 200 such stars located within 15 parsecs, collecting four high-resolution spectra of each M dwarf over six years and performing intensive follow-up monitoring of two candidate radial-velocity variables. We use TRES on the 1.5 m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and CHIRON on the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope for our primary campaign, and MAROON-X on Gemini North for high-precision follow-up.

Beyond the snow line (\$100\$ K \${$<$} T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eq\} {$<$} 150\$ K), we place 95\%-confidence upper limits of 1.5\%, 1.7\%, and 4.4\% (68\%-confidence limits of 0.58\%, 0.66\%, and 1.7\%) for 3M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\} {$<$} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$sin\$i {$<$} 10\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$, 0.8M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\} {$<$} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$sin\$i {$<$} 3\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$, and 0.3M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\} {$<$} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$sin\$i {$<$} 0.8\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$ giant planets; i.e., Jupiter analogs are rare around low-mass M dwarfs. In contrast, surveys of Sun-like stars have found that their giant planets are most common at these Jupiter-like instellations.},

  abstract = {A minimal cell can be thought of as comprising informational, compartment-forming and metabolic subsystems. To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The perceived differences and incompatibilities between these subsystems have led to the widely held assumption that one or other subsystem must have preceded the others. Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)--Cu(II) photoredox cycling.},

  abstract = {F-type star--planet systems represent an intriguing case for habitability studies. Although F-type stars spend considerably less time on the main sequence (MS) than G-, K-, and M-type stars, they still offer a unique set of features, allowing for the principal possibility of exolife. Examples of these features include the increased widths of stellar habitable zones as well as the presence of enhanced UV flux, which in moderation may have added to the origin of life in the Universe. In this study, we pursue a detailed statistical analysis of the currently known planet-hosting F-type stars by making use of the NASA Exoplanet Archive. After disregarding systems with little or no information on the planet(s), we identify 206 systems of interest. We also evaluate whether the stars are on the MS based on various criteria. In one approach, we use the stellar evolution code MESA. Depending on the adopted criterion, about 60--80 stars have been identified as MS stars. In 18 systems, the planet spends at least part of its orbit within the stellar habitable zone. In one case, i.e., HD 111998, known as 38 Vir, the planet is situated in the habitable zone at all times. Our work may serve as a basis for future studies, including studies on the existence of Earth-mass planets in F-type systems, as well as investigations of possibly habitable exomoons hosted by exo-Jupiters, as the lowest-mass habitable zone planet currently identified has a mass estimate of 143 Earth masses.},

  abstract = {A key outstanding question in star and planet formation is how far the initial mass function of stars and sub-stellar objects extends, and whether or not there is a cut-off at the very lowest masses. Isolated objects in the planetary-mass domain below 13 Jupiter masses, where not even deuterium can fuse, are very challenging to observe as these objects are inherently faint. Nearby star-forming regions provide the best opportunity to search for them though: while they are young, they are still relatively warm and luminous at infrared wavelengths. Previous surveys have discovered a handful of such sources down to 3--5 Jupiter masses, around the minimum mass limit established for formation via the fragmentation of molecular clouds, but does the mass function extend further? In a new James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared survey of the inner Orion Nebula and Trapezium Cluster, we have discovered and characterised a sample of 540 planetary-mass candidates with masses down to 0.6 Jupiter masses, demonstrating that there is indeed no sharp cut-off in the mass function. Furthermore, we find that 9{\textbackslash}\% of the planetary-mass objects are in wide binaries, a result that is highly unexpected and which challenges current theories of both star and planet formation.},

In this study, we evaluate the extent to which the photometry in three common bandpasses (r{$\prime$}, i{$\prime$}, z{$\prime$}), and SPECULOOS' primary bandpass (I~+~z{$\prime$}), are photometrically affected by PWV variability. In this selection of bandpasses, the I~+~z{$\prime$} bandpass was found to be most sensitive to PWV variability, followed by z{$\prime$}, i{$\prime$}, and r{$\prime$}. The correction was evaluated on global light curves of nearby late M- and L-type stars observed by SPECULOOS' Southern Observatory (SSO) with the I~+~z{$\prime$} bandpass, using PWV measurements from the LHATPRO and local temperature/humidity sensors. A median reduction in RMS of 1.1~per\,cent was observed for variability shorter than the expected transit duration for SSO's targets. On timescales longer than the expected transit duration, where long-term variability may be induced, a median reduction in RMS of 53.8~per\,cent was observed for the same method of correction.},

  abstract = {The Euclid mission is the second M-class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision programme, with the principal science goal of studying dark energy through observations of weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations. Euclid is also expected to undertake additional Legacy Science programmes. One such proposal is the Exoplanet Euclid Legacy Survey (ExELS) which will be the first survey able to measure the abundance of exoplanets down to Earth mass for host separations from {$\sim$}1~au out to the free-floating (unbound) regime. The cold and free-floating exoplanet regimes represent a crucial discovery space for testing planet formation theories. ExELS will use the gravitational microlensing technique and will detect 1000 microlensing events per month over 1.6\,deg2 of the Galactic bulge. We assess how many of these events will have detectable planetary signatures using a detailed multiwavelength microlensing simulator~-- the Manchester--Besan{\c c}on microLensing Simulator (MAB{$\mu$}LS)~-- which incorporates the Besan{\c c}on Galactic model with 3D extinction. MAB{$\mu$}LS is the first theoretical simulation of microlensing to treat the effects of point spread function (PSF) blending self-consistently with the underlying Galactic model. We use MAB{$\mu$}LS, together with current numerical models for the Euclid PSFs, to explore a number of designs and de-scope options for ExELS, including the exoplanet yield as a function of filter choice and slewing time, and the effect of systematic photometry errors. Using conservative extrapolations of current empirical exoplanet mass functions determined from ground-based microlensing and radial velocity surveys, ExELS can expect to detect a few hundred cold exoplanets around mainly G-, K- and M-type stellar hosts, including {$\sim$}45 Earth-mass planets and {$\sim$}6 Mars-mass planets for an observing programme totalling 10 months. ExELS will be capable of measuring the cold exoplanet mass function down to Earth mass or below, with orbital separations ranging from {$\sim$}1~au out to infinity (i.e. the free-floating regime). Recent ground-based microlensing measurements indicate a significant population of free-floating Jupiters, in which case ExELS will detect hundreds of free-floating planets. ExELS will also be sensitive to hot exoplanets and sub-stellar companions through their transit signatures and this is explored in a companion paper.},

The WFIRST mission was chosen as the top-priority large space mission of the 2010 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey in order to achieve three primary goals: to study dark energy via a wide-field imaging survey, to study exoplanets via a microlensing survey, and to enable a guest observer program. Here we assess the ability of the several WFIRST designs to achieve the goal of the microlensing survey to discover a large sample of cold, low-mass exoplanets with semimajor axes beyond roughly one astronomical unit, which are largely impossible to detect with any other technique. We present the results of a suite of simulations that span the full range of the proposed WFIRST architectures, from the original design envisioned by the decadal survey, to the current design, which utilizes a 2.4 m telescope donated to NASA. By studying such a broad range of architectures, we are able to determine the impact of design trades on the expected yields of detected exoplanets. In estimating the yields we take particular care to ensure that our assumed Galactic model predicts microlensing event rates that match observations, consider the impact that inaccuracies in the Galactic model might have on the yields, and ensure that numerical errors in light-curve computations do not bias the yields for the smallest-mass exoplanets. For the nominal baseline WFIRST design and a fiducial planet mass function, we predict that a total of {$\sim$}1400 bound exoplanets with mass greater than {$\sim$}0.1 M {$\oplus$} should be detected, including {$\sim$}200 with mass {$\lessequivlnt$}3 M {$\oplus$}. WFIRST should have sensitivity to planets with mass down to {$\sim$}0.02 M {$\oplus$}, or roughly the mass of Ganymede.},

  abstract = {Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey (A spectral Light Investigation into hot gas Giant origiNs by the collaboration of Bristol, Oxford, Warwick, Imperial, Exeter, ~+) will compare the compositions of eight hot Jupiters around F stars, four with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis, and four misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{ O\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ /H\}{\textbackslash}ge 10 {\textbackslash}times\$\,solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (\${\textbackslash}lt 0.25\$) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O \${\textbackslash}gt 0.6\$), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.},

  abstract = {Planets and their host stars carry a long-term memory of their origin in their chemical compositions. Thus, identifying planets formed in different environments improves our understating of planetary formation. Although restricted to detecting exoplanets within the solar vicinity, we might be able to detect planetary systems that formed in small external galaxies and later merged with the Milky Way. In fact, Gaia data have unequivocally shown that the Galaxy underwent several significant minor mergers during its first billion years of formation. The stellar debris of one of these mergers, Gaia-Enceladus (GE), is thought to have built up most of the stellar halo in the solar neighborhood. In this Letter, we investigate the origin of known planet-host stars combining data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with Gaia EDR3 and large-scale spectroscopic surveys. We adopt a kinematic criterion and identify 42 stars associated with the Milky Way's thick disk and one halo star. The only halo star identified, BD+20 2457, known to harbor two exoplanets, moves on a retrograde and highly eccentric orbit. Its chemical abundance pattern situates the star at the border between the thick disk, the old halo, and accreted populations. Given its orbital parameters and chemical properties, we suggest that BD+20 2457 is likely formed in the protodisk of the Galaxy, but we do not exclude the possibility of the star belonging to the debris of GE. Finally, we estimate a minimum age and mass limit for the star, which has implications for its planetary system and will be tested with future Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations.},

We use two approaches to estimate detectable planetary systems: one based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the astrometric signature per field crossing, easily reproducible and allowing comparisons with previous estimates, and a new and more robust metric based on orbit fitting to the simulated satellite data. With some plausible assumptions on planet occurrences, we find that some 21,000 ({\textpm}6000) high-mass ({$\sim$}1--15MJ) long-period planets should be discovered out to distances of {$\sim$}500 pc for the nominal 5 yr mission (including at least 1000--1500 around M dwarfs out to 100 pc), rising to some 70,000 ({\textpm}20, 000) for a 10 yr mission.

  abstract = {Highly irradiated planets in the hot Neptune desert are usually either small (R {$<$} 2 Rearth) and rocky or they are gas giants with radii of {$>$}1 Rjup. Here, we report on the intermediate-sized planet TOI-2196 on a 1.2 day orbit around a G-type star discovered by TESS in sector 27. We collected 42 radial velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph to determine the mass. The radius of TOI-2196 b is 3.51 +/- 0.15 Rearth, which, combined with the mass of 26.0 +/- 1.3 Mearth, results in a bulk density of 3.31+0.51-0.43 g/cm3. Hence, the radius implies that this planet is a sub-Neptune, although the density is twice than that of Neptune. A significant trend in the HARPS radial velocities points to the presence of a distant companion with a lower limit on the period and mass of 220 days and 0.65 Mjup, respectively, assuming zero eccentricity. The short period of planet b implies a high equilibrium temperature of 1860 +/- 20 K, for zero albedo and isotropic emission. This places the planet in the hot Neptune desert, joining a group of very few planets in this parameter space discovered in recent years. These planets suggest that the hot Neptune desert may be divided in two parts for planets with equilibrium temperatures of {$>$} 1800 K: a hot sub-Neptune desert devoid of planets with radii of 1.8-3 Rearth and a sub-Jovian desert for radii of 5-12 Rearth. More planets in this parameter space are needed to further investigate this finding. Planetary interior structure models of TOI-2196 b are consistent with a H/He atmosphere mass fraction between 0.4 \% and 3 \%, with a mean value of 0.7 \% on top of a rocky interior. We estimated the amount of mass this planet might have lost at a young age, and we find that while the mass loss could have been significant, the planet had not changed in terms of character: it was born as a small volatile-rich planet, and it remains one at present.},

Studies are therefore dependent on subgrid models to emulate the micro physics of dust coagulation on top of a large scale hydrodynamic simulation. Numerical simulations which include the relevant physical effects are complex and computationally expensive. Here, we present a fast and accurate learned effective model for dust coagulation, trained on data from high resolution numerical coagulation simulations. Our model captures details of the dust coagulation process that were so far not tractable with other dust coagulation prescriptions with similar computational efficiency.},

Telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope and mission concepts like HabEx, LUVOIR, and Origins are designed to characterize rocky exoplanets spectroscopically. However, spectroscopy remains time-intensive, and therefore, initial characterization is critical to prioritization of targets. Here, we study machine learning as a tool to assess water's existence through broad-band filter reflected photometric flux on Earth-like exoplanets in three forms: seawater, water-clouds, and snow; based on 53~130 spectra of cold, Earth-like planets with six major surfaces. XGBoost, a well-known machine-learning algorithm, achieves over 90~per\,cent balanced accuracy in detecting the existence of snow or clouds for S/N {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20, and 70~per\,cent for liquid seawater for S/N {$\greaterequivlnt$} 30. Finally, we perform mock Bayesian analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo with five filters identified to derive exact surface compositions to test for retrieval feasibility. The results show that the use of machine learning to identify water on the surface of exoplanets from broad-band filter photometry provides a promising initial characterization tool of water in different forms. Planned small and large telescope missions could use this to aid their prioritization of targets for time-intense follow-up observations.},

At a distance of 6.9 pc, this system is the second closest known transiting system and will be observed through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming Twinkle mission. Twinkle is equipped with a 0.45 m telescope, covers a spectral wavelength range of 0.5 - 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m simultaneously with a resolving power between 50 - 70, and is designed to study exoplanets, bright stars, and solar system objects. We investigate the mission's potential to study LTT 1445 Ab and find that Twinkle data can distinguish between a cold Haber World (N\$\_2\$-H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere) and a Hycean World with a H\$\_2\$O-H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere, with a \${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ = 3.01. Interior composition analysis favors a Haber World scenario for LTT 1445 Ab, which suggests that the planet probably lacks a substantial water layer. We use petitRADTRANS and a Twinkle simulator to simulate transmission spectra for the more likely scenario of a cold Haber World for which NH\$\_\{3\}\$ is considered to be a biosignature. We study the detectability under different scenarios: varying hydrogen fraction, concentration of ammonia, and cloud coverage. We find that ammonia can be detected at a \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level for optimal (non-cloudy) conditions with 25 transits and a volume mixing ration of 4.0 ppm of NH\$\_\{3\}\$. We provide examples of retrieval analysis to constrain potential NH\$\_\{3\}\$ and H\$\_\{2\}\$O in the atmosphere.

  abstract = {The population of planets smaller than approximately 1.7\,Earth radii (R{$\oplus$}) is widely interpreted as consisting of rocky worlds, generally referred to as super-Earths. This picture is largely corroborated by radial velocity mass measurements for close-in super-Earths but lacks constraints at lower insolations. Here we present the results of a detailed study of the Kepler-138 system using 13 Hubble and Spitzer transit observations of the warm-temperate 1.51\,{\textpm}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} planet Kepler-138 d (\$\$\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{eq,A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{B\}\} = 0.3\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 350{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\}\$\$) combined with new radial velocity measurements of its host star obtained with the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We find evidence for a volatile-rich `water world' nature of Kepler-138 d, with a large fraction of its mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\}\$ contained in a thick volatile layer. This finding is independently supported by transit timing variations and radial velocity observations (\$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{1\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$\$), as well as the flat optical/infrared transmission spectrum. Quantitatively, we infer a composition of \$\$1\{1\}\_\{-4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3\}{\textbackslash}\%\$\$volatiles by mass or {\textasciitilde}51\% by volume, with a 2,000-km-deep water mantle and atmosphere on top of a core with an Earth-like silicates/iron ratio. Any hypothetical hydrogen layer consistent with the observations ({$<$}0.003\,M{$\oplus$}) would have swiftly been lost on a {\textasciitilde}10\,Myr timescale. The bulk composition of Kepler-138 d therefore resembles those of the icy moons, rather than the terrestrial planets, in the Solar System. We conclude that not all super-Earths are rocky worlds, but that volatile-rich water worlds exist in an overlapping size regime, especially at lower insolations. Finally, our photodynamical analysis also reveals that Kepler-138 c (with a Rc\,=\,1.51\,{\textpm}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} and a \$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{c\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{3\}\_\{-0.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$\$) is a slightly warmer twin of Kepler-138 d (that is, another water world in the same system) and we infer the presence of Kepler-138 e, a likely non-transiting planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone.},

The Laplace angles associated with neighbouring triplets are observed to be librating, proving the resonant nature of the system. This compact, resonant configuration is a manifest sign of disc-driven migration; however, the preferred outcome of such evolution is the establishment of first-order resonances, not the high-order resonances observed in the inner system. Here, we explain the observed orbital configuration in a model that is largely independent on the specific disc migration and orbital circularisation efficiencies. Together with migration, the two key elements of our model are: i) the inner border of the protoplanetary disc receded with time; and ii) the system was initially separated in two sub-systems. Specifically, the inner b, c d and e planets were initially placed in a 3:2 resonance chain and then evolved to the 8:5 -- 5:3 commensurability between planets b, c and d under the effect of the recession of the inner edge of the disc, whereas the outer planets migrated to the inner edge at a later time, establishing the remaining resonances. Our results pivot on the dynamical role of the presently unobservable recession of the inner edge of protoplanetary discs. They also reveal the role of recurring phases of convergent migration followed by resonant repulsion with associated orbital circularisation when resonant chains interact with migration barriers.},

Using a one-dimensional radiative--convective model, we find that 40 bars of pure H2 on a three Earth-mass planet can maintain a surface temperature of 280 K out to 1.5 AU from an early-type M dwarf star and 10 AU from a G-type star. Neglecting the effects of clouds and of gaseous absorbers besides H2, the flux at the surface would be sufficient for photosynthesis by cyanobacteria (in the G star case) or anoxygenic phototrophs (in the M star case). We argue that primordial atmospheres of one to several hundred bars of H2--He are possible and use a model of hydrogen escape to show that such atmospheres are likely to persist further than 1.5 AU from M stars, and 2 AU from G stars, assuming these planets have protecting magnetic fields. We predict that the microlensing planet OGLE-05-390Lb could have retained an H2--He atmosphere and be habitable at {$\sim$}2.6 AU from its host M star.},

  abstract = {The implications of the water vapor runaway greenhouse phenomenon for water-rich subNeptunes are developed. In particular, the nature of the post-runaway equilibration process for planets that have an extremely high water inventory is addressed. Crossing the threshold from sub-runaway to super-runaway conditions leads to a transition from equilibrated states with cold deep liquid oceans and deep interior ice-X phases to states with hot supercritical fluid interiors. There is a corresponding marked inflation of radius for a given mass, similar to the runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect noted earlier for terrestrial planets, but in the present case the inflation involves the entire interior of the planet. The calculation employs the AQUA equation of state database to simplify the internal structure calculation. Some speculations concerning the effect of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2\}\$ admixture, silicate cores and hot vs. cold start evolution trajectories are offered. Observational implications are discussed, though the search for the mass-radius signature of the phenomena considered is limited by degeneracies and by lack of data.},

The disk around CIDA 1 ({\textasciitilde}0.1--0.2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) is one of the very few known disks that host a large cavity (20 au radius in size) around a very low-mass star. We present new ALMA observations at Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm) of CIDA 1 with a resolution of {\textasciitilde}0.05{${''}$} {\texttimes} 0.034{${''}$}. These new ALMA observations reveal a very bright and unresolved inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust emission ({\textasciitilde}2), and a complex morphology of a ring located at 20 au. We also present X-shooter (VLT) observations that confirm the high accretion rate of CIDA 1 of \emph{{\.M}{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{acc{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 1.4 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{-8{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}.

Even in this planet mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop the particles from migrating inwards and to maintain a bright inner disk on timescales of millions of years. Such mechanisms include a trap formed by a very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral index of the disk around CIDA 1 is difficult to explain and challenges our current dust evolution models, in particular processes like fragmentation, growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In addition, the dust radial drift of particles is expected to be a more difficult barrier to overcome during the first steps of planet formation in these disks. ALMA high-angular resolution observations of few protoplanetary disks around BDs and VLMS have shown substructures as in the disks around Sun-like stars. Such observations suggest that giant planets embedded in the disks are the most likely origin of the observed substructures. However, this type of planets represent less than 2\% of the confirmed exoplanets so far around all stars, and they are difficult to form by different core accretion models (either pebble or planetesimal accretion). Dedicated deep observations of disks around BDs and VLMS with ALMA and JWST will provide significant progress on understanding the main properties of these objects (e.g., disk size and mass), which is crucial for determining the physical mechanisms that rule the evolution of these disks and the effect on the potential planets that may form in these environments.},

  abstract = {During accretion, the young rocky planets are so hot that they become endowed with a magma ocean. From that moment, the mantle convective thermal flux control the cooling of the planet and an atmosphere is created by outgassing. This atmosphere will then play a key role during this cooling phase. Studying this cooling phase in details is a necessary step to explain the great diversity of the observed telluric planets and especially to assess the presence of surface liquid water. We used here a radiative-convective 1D atmospheric model (H2O, CO2) to study the impact of the Bond albedo on the evolution of magma ocean planets. We derived from this model the thermal emission spectrum and the spectral reflectance of these planets, from which we calculated their Bond albedos. Compared to Marcq et~al. (2017), the model now includes a new module to compute the Rayleigh scattering, and state of the art CO2 and H2O gaseous opacities data in the visible and infrared spectral ranges. We show that the Bond albedo of these planets depends on their surface temperature and results from a competition between Rayleigh scattering from the gases and Mie scattering from the clouds. The colder the surface temperature is, the thicker the clouds are, and the higher the Bond albedo is. We also evidence that the relative abundances of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere strongly impact the Bond albedo. The Bond albedo is higher for atmospheres dominated by the CO2, better Rayleigh scatterer than H2O. Finally, we provide the community with an empirical formula for the Bond albedo that could be useful for future studies of magma ocean planets.},

  abstract = {Planet obliquity is the alignment or misalignment of a planet spin axis relative to its orbit normal. In a multiplanet system, this obliquity is a valuable signature of planet formation and evolutionary history. The young \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris system hosts two coplanar super-Jupiters and upcoming JWST observations of this system will constrain the obliquity of the outer planet, \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris b. This will be the first planet obliquity measurement in an extrasolar, multiplanet system. First, we show that this new planet obliquity is likely misaligned by using a wide range of simulated observations in combination with published measurements of the system. Motivated by current explanations for the tilted planet obliquities in the Solar System, we consider collisions and secular spin-orbit resonances. While collisions are unlikely to occur, secular spin-orbit resonance modified by the presence of an exomoon around the outer planet can excite a large obliquity. The largest induced obliquities (\${\textbackslash}sim 60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$) occur for moons with at least a Neptune-mass and a semimajor axis of \$0.03-0.05{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{au\}\$ (\$40-70\$ planet radii). For certain orbital alignments, such a moon may observably transit the planet (transit depth of \$3-7{\textbackslash}\%\$, orbital period of \$3-7\$ weeks). Thus, a nonzero obliquity detection of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris b implies that it may host a large exomoon. Although we focus on the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris system, the idea that the presence of exomoons can excite high obliquities is very general and applicable to other exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {Water-rich planets such as Earth are expected to become eventually uninhabitable, because liquid water turns unstable at the surface as temperatures increase with solar luminosity. Whether a large increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2 could also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear. Here we show with three-dimensional aqua-planet simulations that CO2-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback and leads to a new steady state with global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330\,K. The upper atmosphere is considerably moister in this warm state than in the reference climate, implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to space. For some elevated CO2 or solar forcings, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the climate transition cannot be reversed by removing the additional forcing.},

  abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the hot (approximately 1,100\,K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1--3 suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres4. This is because of the low ({$<$}1\,ppb) abundance of SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1--10\,ppm)4--9. However, the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05\,{$\mu$}m and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2 abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5\,{$\mu$}m in the 5--12-{$\mu$}m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5--25\,ppm (1{$\sigma$} range), consistent with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10\,{$\mu$}m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1--8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.},

  abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale for and the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

  abstract = {The Atmospheric Remote sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large survey (ARIEL) mission is an M-class mission candidate within the science program Cosmic Vision of the European Space Agency (ESA). It was selected in June 2015 as one of three candidates to enter an assessment phase (phase 0/A). This process involves the definition of science and mission requirements as well as a preliminary model payload, and an internal Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study providing the input to parallel industrial studies (in progress since 2016). After this process, the three candidates will be reviewed and in mid-2017 one of them will be selected as the M4 mission for launch in 2026. ARIEL is a survey-type mission dedicated to the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. Using the differential technique of transit spectroscopy, ARIEL will obtain transmission and/or emission spectra of the atmospheres of a large and diverse sample of known exoplanets ({\textasciitilde}500) covering a wide range of masses, densities, equilibrium temperatures, orbital properties and host-star characteristics. This will include hot Jupiters to warm Super-Earths, orbiting M5 to F0 stars. This paper describes critical requirements, and reports on the results of the Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study that was conducted in June / July 2015, providing a description of the resulting spacecraft design. It will employ a 0.7 m x 1.1 m off-axis three mirror telescope, feeding four photometric channels in the VNIR range (0.5-1.95 \&mu;m) and an IR spectrometer covering 1.95-7.8 \&mu;m.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale that can spatially separate the signals from exoplanets and their host stars and thus directly scrutinize the exoplanets and their atmospheres.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. We study the impact of various parameters and compare the performance with that of large single-aperture mission concepts that detect exoplanets in reflected light.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc of the Sun. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect. Considering single visits only, we discuss two different scenarios for distributing 2.5 yr of an initial search phase among the stellar targets. Different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are investigated.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} An interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures working in the 4--18.5 {$\mu$}.m wavelength range with a total instrument throughput of 5\% could detect up to {$\approx$}550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} with an integrated \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\geq$} 7. At least {$\approx$}160 of the detected exoplanets have radii {$\leq$}1.5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}. Depending on the observing scenario, {$\approx$}25--45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With four 3.5 m apertures, the total number of detections can increase to up to {$\approx$}770, including {$\approx$}60--80 rocky eHZ planets. With four times 1 m apertures, the maximum detection yield is {$\approx$}315 exoplanets, including {$\leq$}20 rocky eHZ planets. The vast majority of small, temperate exoplanets are detected around M dwarfs. The impact of changing the wavelength range to 3--20 {$\mu$}m or 6--17 {$\mu$}m on the detection yield is negligible.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} A large space-based MIR nulling interferometer will be able to directly detect hundreds of small, nearby exoplanets, tens of which would be habitable world candidates. This shows that such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. Further increasing the number of habitable world candidates, in particular around solar-type stars, appears possible via the implementation of a multi-visit strategy during the search phase. The high median S/N of most of the detected planets will allow for first estimates of their radii and effective temperatures and will help prioritize the targets for a second mission phase to obtain high-S/N thermal emission spectra, leveraging the superior diagnostic power of the MIR regime compared to shorter wavelengths.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Exoplanet science is one of the most thriving fields of modern astrophysics. A major goal is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small, terrestrial exoplanets in order to search for signatures in their atmospheres that indicate biological activity, assess their ability to provide conditions for life as we know it, and investigate their expected atmospheric diversity. None of the currently adopted projects or missions, from ground or in space, can address these goals. In this White Paper, submitted to ESA in response to the Voyage 2050 Call, we argue that a large space-based mission designed to detect and investigate thermal emission spectra of terrestrial exoplanets in the mid-infrared wavelength range provides unique scientific potential to address these goals and surpasses the capabilities of other approaches. While NASA might be focusing on large missions that aim to detect terrestrial planets in reflected light, ESA has the opportunity to take leadership and spearhead the development of a large mid-infrared exoplanet mission within the scope of the "Voyage 2050" long-term plan establishing Europe at the forefront of exoplanet science for decades to come. Given the ambitious science goals of such a mission, additional international partners might be interested in participating and contributing to a roadmap that, in the long run, leads to a successful implementation. A new, dedicated development program funded by ESA to help reduce development and implementation cost and further push some of the required key technologies would be a first important step in this direction. Ultimately, a large mid-infrared exoplanet imaging mission will be needed to help answer one of humankind's most fundamental questions: "How unique is our Earth?"},

Hitherto, numerical models designed to explore these late stage collisions have been limited by assuming that all collisions lead to perfect accretion, and many of these studies lack the large number of realizations needed to account for the chaotic nature of N-body systems. We improve on these limitations by performing 280 simulations of planet formation around a Sun-like star, half of which used an N-body algorithm that has recently been modified to include fragmentation and hit-and-run (bouncing) collisions. We find that when fragmentation is included, the final planets formed are comparable in terms of mass and number; however, their collision histories differ significantly and the accretion time approximately doubles. We explored impacts onto Earth-like planets, which we parameterized in terms of their specific impact energies. Only 15 of our 164 Earth-analogs experienced an impact that was energetic enough to strip an entire atmosphere. To strip about half of an atmosphere requires energies comparable to recent models of the Moon-forming giant impact. Almost all Earth-analogs received at least one impact that met this criteria during the 2 Gyr simulations and the median was three giant impacts. The median time of the giant impact was 43 Myr after the start of the simulations, leading us to conclude that the time-frame of the Moon-forming impact is typical among planetary systems around Sun-like stars.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES radial-velocity survey is currently searching for planets in a sample of 387 M dwarfs. Here we report on two Saturn-mass planets orbiting TYC 2187-512-1 (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star = 0.50 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and TZ Ari (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star = 0.15 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), respectively. We obtained supplementary photometric time series, which we use along with spectroscopic information to determine the rotation periods of the two stars. In both cases, the radial velocities also show strong modulations at the respective rotation period. We thus modeled the radial velocities as a Keplerian orbit plus a Gaussian process representing the stellar variability. TYC 2187-512-1 is found to harbor a planet with a minimum mass of 0.33 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ in a near-circular 692-day orbit. The companion of TZ Ari has a minimum mass of 0.21 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$, orbital period of 771 d, and orbital eccentricity of 0.46. We provide an overview of all known giant planets in the CARMENES sample, from which we infer an occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs with periods up to 2 years in the range between 2\% to 6\%. TZ Ari b is only the second giant planet discovered orbiting a host with mass less than 0.3 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. These objects occupy an extreme location in the planet mass versus host mass plane. It is difficult to explain their formation in core-accretion scenarios, so they may possibly have been formed through a disk fragmentation process.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3--5.5 {$\mu$}m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10{\texttimes} larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions and faculae covering fractions . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1--15{\texttimes} the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

The spatial distribution of liquid water and its change during the pre-main-sequence phase of protoplanetary systems is important for understanding how planets become habitable. Such worlds are interesting targets for future missions because the coolest stars could provide habitable conditions for up to 2.5 billion years post-accretion. Moreover, for a given star type, planetary systems are more easily resolved because of higher pre-main-sequence stellar luminosities, resulting in larger planet--star separation for cool stars than is the case for the traditional main-sequence (MS) HZ. We use one-dimensional radiative--convective climate and stellar evolutionary models to calculate pre-main-sequence HZ distances for F1-M8 stellar types. We also show that accreting planets that are later located in the traditional MS HZ orbiting stars cooler than a K5 (including the full range of M stars) receive stellar fluxes that exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold, and thus may lose substantial amounts of water initially delivered to them. We predict that M-star planets need to initially accrete more water than Earth did, or, alternatively, have additional water delivered later during the long pre-MS phase to remain habitable. Our findings are also consistent with recent claims that Venus lost its water during accretion.},

We show that 10\% CH4 can increase the outer edge distance of the hottest stars (TEFF = 10,000 K) by over 20\%. In contrast, the CH4 anti-greenhouse can shrink the HZ for the coolest stars (TEFF = 2600 K) by a similar percentage.

Given its importance, the precise size and location of the HZ remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have assessed various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and planetary mass. However, little work has assessed how the HZ changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure, which is directly connected to the habitability and life-bearing potential of planets. Here, I use an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our Solar system's HZ is {$\sim$}0.9--1.7 au, assuming a 5-bar nitrogen background pressure and a maximum 100~per\,cent cloud cover at the inner edge. This width is {$\sim$}20~per\,cent wider than the conservative HZ estimate. Similar extensions are calculated for A--M stars. I also show that cooling clouds/hazes and high background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse threshold temperature to {$\sim$}300~K (or less) for planets orbiting any star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be triggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for planets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway greenhouse above {$\sim$}330~K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with previous work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting A-stars.},

In this work, we explore the impact of UV light on prebiotic chemistry that might occur in liquid water on the surface of a planet with an atmosphere. We consider effects including atmospheric absorption, attenuation by water, and stellar variability to constrain the UV input as a function of wavelength. We conclude that the UV environment would be characterized by broadband input, and wavelengths below 204\,nm and 168\,nm would be shielded out by atmospheric CO2 and water, respectively. We compare this broadband prebiotic UV input to the narrowband UV sources (e.g., mercury lamps) often used in laboratory studies of prebiotic chemistry and explore the implications for the conclusions drawn from these experiments. We consider as case studies the ribonucleotide synthesis pathway of Powner et al. (2009) and the sugar synthesis pathway of Ritson and Sutherland (2012). Irradiation by narrowband UV light from a mercury lamp formed an integral component of these studies; we quantitatively explore the impact of more realistic UV input on the conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments. Finally, we explore the constraints solar UV input places on the buildup of prebiotically important feedstock gasses like CH4 and HCN. Our results demonstrate the importance of characterizing the wavelength dependence (action spectra) of prebiotic synthesis pathways to determine how pathways derived under laboratory irradiation conditions will function under planetary prebiotic conditions.

Here, we present two-stream multilayer clear-sky calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9\,Ga to constrain the UV surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of {$>$}10.4; for the same atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Hence, surface conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences. For climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189\,nm is screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding from CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible levels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off comparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can build up to the {$\geq$}1--100\,ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H2O is a robust UV shield for {$\lambda$}\,{$<$}\,198\,nm. This means that regardless of the levels of other atmospheric gases, fluence {$\lessequivlnt$}198\,nm is only available for cold, dry atmospheres, meaning sources with emission {$\lessequivlnt$}198 (e.g., ArF excimer lasers) can only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254\,nm is unshielded by H2O and is available across a broad range of , meaning that mercury lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in primordial H2O and CO2 levels.

These findings have revived interest in the hypothesis that prebiotically important molecules or even nascent life may have formed on Mars and been transferred to Earth. UV light plays a key role in prebiotic chemistry. Characterizing the early martian surface UV environment is key to understanding how Mars compares to Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry. Here, we present two-stream, multilayer calculations of the UV surface radiance on Mars at 3.9\,Ga to constrain the surface UV environment as a function of atmospheric state. We explore a wide range of atmospheric pressures, temperatures, and compositions that correspond to the diversity of martian atmospheric states consistent with available constraints. We include the effects of clouds and dust. We calculate dose rates to quantify the effect of different atmospheric states on UV-sensitive prebiotic chemistry. We find that, for normative clear-sky CO2-H2O atmospheres, the UV environment on young Mars is comparable to young Earth. This similarity is robust to moderate cloud cover; thick clouds ({$\tau$}cloud\,{$\geq$}\,100) are required to significantly affect the martian UV environment, because cloud absorption is degenerate with atmospheric CO2. On the other hand, absorption from SO2, H2S, and dust is nondegenerate with CO2, meaning that, if these constituents build up to significant levels, surface UV fluence can be suppressed. These absorbers have spectrally variable absorption, meaning that their presence affects prebiotic pathways in different ways. In particular, high SO2 environments may admit UV fluence that favors pathways conducive to abiogenesis over pathways unfavorable to it. However, better measurements of the spectral quantum yields of these pathways are required to evaluate this hypothesis definitively.

Key molecular targets of such searches include O\$\_2\$ and CO, which are potential indicators of life. Recently, it was proposed that CO\$\_2\$ photolysis generates abundant (\$rsim0.1\$ bar) abiotic O\$\_2\$ and CO in the atmospheres of habitable M-dwarf planets with CO\$\_2\$-rich atmospheres, constituting a strong false positive for O\$\_2\$ as a biosignature and further complicating efforts to use CO as a diagnostic of surface biology. Significantly, this implied that TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1f, now under observation with JWST, would abiotically accumulate abundant O\$\_2\$ and CO, if habitable. Here, we use a multi-model approach to re-examine photochemical O\$\_2\$ and CO accumulation on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. We show that photochemical O\$\_2\$ remains a trace gas on habitable CO\$\_2\$-rich M-dwarf planets, with earlier predictions of abundant O\$\_2\$ and CO due to an atmospheric model top that was too low to accurately resolve the unusually-high CO\$\_2\$ photolysis peak on such worlds. Our work strengthens the case for O\$\_2\$ as a biosignature gas, and affirms the importance of CO as a diagnostic of photochemical O\$\_2\$ production. However, observationally relevant false positive potential remains, especially for O\$\_2\$'s photochemical product O\$\_3\$, and further work is required to confidently understand O\$\_2\$ and O\$\_3\$ as biosignature gases on M-dwarf planets.},

  abstract = {Characterizing rocky exoplanet atmospheres is a key goal of exoplanet science, but interpreting such observations will require understanding the stellar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation incident on the planet from its host star. Stellar UV mediates atmospheric escape, photochemistry, and planetary habitability, and observations of rocky exoplanets can only be understood in the context of the UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of their host stars. Particularly important are SEDs from observationally favorable but poorly understood low-mass M-dwarf stars, which are the only plausible targets for rocky planet atmospheric characterization for the next 1-2 decades. In this work, we explore the utility of AstroSat UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) for the characterization of the UV SEDs of low-mass stars. We present observations of the nearby M0 star HIP 23309 in the far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings of UVIT. Our FUV spectra are consistent with contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and our NUV spectra are stable between orbits, suggesting UVIT is a viable tool for the characterization of the SEDs of low-mass stars. We apply our measured spectra to simulations of photochemistry and habitability for a hypothetical rocky planet orbiting HIP 23309 and elucidate the utility and limitations of UVIT in deriving UV SEDs of M-dwarf exoplanet hosts. Our work validates UVIT as a tool to complement HST in the characterization of exoplanet host stars and carries implications for its successor missions like INSIST.},

  abstract = {Solar radiation was overwhelmingly the largest source of energy on the early Earth. Energy provided by the Sun has the potential to access different chemistries than energy provided by other sources, such as hydrothermal vents, because of the unique characteristics of photochemistry that differentiate it from conventional thermal chemistry. This review considers how sunlight-driven reactions can abiotically generate prebiotic molecules necessary for the evolution of life. We discuss briefly the characteristics of the early Sun and the likely environmental conditions on the early Earth because photochemistry is both environment- and molecule-specific. An overview of the fundamental principles of photophysics and photochemistry is followed by discussion of a selection of prebiotically-relevant examples of photochemical reactions, focusing on syntheses that lead to the production of cellular components (e.g. sugars, lipids, and biopolymer precursors). The role of photostability as an evolutionary driving force is also considered. These examples highlight the ability of simple organic molecules to harness solar energy and convert it into high-energy chemical bonds, generating molecular complexity.},

PLATO will carry out transit surveys to detect and characterize planets around bright stars, with special emphasis on small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. PLATO will allow us to determine the planets' radii with unprecedented accuracy, and, thanks to the brightness of its targets, also the planets' masses through ground-based radial velocity observations. With the asteroseismology analysis of the light curves, it will be possible to characterize the planet host stars and to determine their precise ages, covering a large diversity of planetary systems. The PLATO payload consists of 24 telescopes with CCD-based focal planes, which will monitor stars with V {$>$}8 over a wide sky field of view of {\textasciitilde}2232{$^\circ$}2 per pointing. Two additional ``fast'' cameras will be used for stars with V{\textasciitilde}4--8. The nominal duration of the science operations is 4~years.},

  abstract = {PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESA's M3 mission designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and perform asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets (down to {$<$}2 R\_(Earth)) around bright stars ({$<$}11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity observations from the ground, planets will be characterised for their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy (5 \%, 10 \%, 10 \% for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative exoplanetology to place our Solar System planets in a broader context. In parallel, PLATO will study (host) stars using asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution. The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives, present PLATO's target samples and fields, provide an overview of expected core science performance as well as a description of the instrument and the mission profile at the beginning of the serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for a launch date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a summary of the mission to the community in preparation of the upcoming operational phases.},

  abstract = {We present results from 44 simulations of late stage planetary accretion, focusing on the delivery of volatiles (primarily water) to the terrestrial planets. Our simulations include both planetary ``embryos'' (defined as Moon to Mars sized protoplanets) and planetesimals, assuming that the embryos formed via oligarchic growth. We investigate volatile delivery as a function of Jupiter's mass, position and eccentricity, the position of the snow line, and the density (in solids) of the solar nebula. In all simulations, we form 1--4 terrestrial planets inside 2 AU, which vary in mass and volatile content. In 44 simulations we have formed 43 planets between 0.8 and 1.5~AU, including 11 ``habitable'' planets between 0.9 and 1.1~AU. These planets range from dry worlds to ``water worlds'' with 100+oceans of water (1~ocean=1.5{\texttimes}1024~g), and vary in mass between 0.23M{$\oplus$} and 3.85M{$\oplus$}. There is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations, but the most important parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose, which reflects the surface density in solids past the snow line. A high density in this region results in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with larger masses and higher water content, as compared with planets which form in systems with lower densities. We find that an eccentric Jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets with higher eccentricities than a circular one. In cases with Jupiter at 7 AU, we form what we call ``super embryos,'' 1--2M{$\oplus$} protoplanets which can serve as the accretion seeds for 2+M{$\oplus$} planets with large water contents.},

  abstract = {The final stage in the formation of terrestrial planets consists of the accumulation of {$\sim$}1000-km ``planetary embryos'' and a swarm of billions of 1--10 km ``planetesimals.'' During this process, water-rich material is accreted by the terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies from beyond roughly 2.5 AU. We present results from five high-resolution dynamical simulations. These start from 1000--2000 embryos and planetesimals, roughly 5--10 times more particles than in previous simulations. Each simulation formed 2--4 terrestrial planets with masses between 0.4 and 2.6 Earth masses. The eccentricities of most planets were {$\sim$}0.05, lower than in previous simulations, but still higher than for Venus, Earth and Mars. Each planet accreted at least the Earth's current water budget. We demonstrate several new aspects of the accretion process: (1) The feeding zones of terrestrial planets change in time, widening and moving outward. Even in the presence of Jupiter, water-rich material from beyond 2.5 AU is not accreted for several millions of years. (2) Even in the absence of secular resonances, the asteroid belt is cleared of {$>$}99\% of its original mass by self-scattering of bodies into resonances with Jupiter. (3) If planetary embryos form relatively slowly, then the formation of embryos in the asteroid belt may have been stunted by the presence of Jupiter. (4) Self-interacting planetesimals feel dynamical friction from other small bodies, which has important effects on the eccentricity evolution and outcome of a simulation.},

  abstract = {The water content and habitability of terrestrial planets are determined during their final assembly, from perhaps 100 1,000-km ``planetary embryos'' and a swarm of billions of 1--10-km ``planetesimals.'' During this process, we assume that water-rich material is accreted by terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies that originate in the outer asteroid region. We present analysis of water delivery and planetary habitability in five high-resolution simulations containing about 10 times more particles than in previous simulations. These simulations formed 15 terrestrial planets from 0.4 to 2.6 Earth masses, including five planets in the habitable zone. Every planet from each simulation accreted at least the Earth's current water budget; most accreted several times that amount (assuming no impact depletion). Each planet accreted at least five water-rich embryos and planetesimals from the past 2.5 astronomical units; most accreted 10--20 water-rich bodies. We present a new model for water delivery to terrestrial planets in dynamically calm systems, with low-eccentricity or low-mass giant planets---such systems may be very common in the Galaxy. We suggest that water is accreted in comparable amounts from a few planetary embryos in a ``hit or miss'' way and from millions of planetesimals in a statistically robust process. Variations in water content are likely to be caused by fluctuations in the number of water-rich embryos accreted, as well as from systematic effects, such as planetary mass and location, and giant planet properties.

  abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system contains seven roughly Earth-sized planets locked in a multiresonant orbital configuration1,2, which has enabled precise measurements of the planets' masses and constrained their compositions3. Here we use the system's fragile orbital structure to place robust upper limits on the planets' bombardment histories. We use N-body simulations to show how perturbations from additional objects can break the multiresonant configuration by either triggering dynamical instability or simply removing the planets from resonance. The planets cannot have interacted with more than {\textasciitilde}5\% of one Earth mass (M{$\oplus$}) in planetesimals---or a single rogue planet more massive than Earth's Moon---without disrupting their resonant orbital structure. This implies an upper limit of 10-4 M{$\oplus$} to 10-2\,M{$\oplus$} of late accretion on each planet since the dispersal of the system's gaseous disk. This is comparable to (or less than) the late accretion on Earth after the Moon-forming impact4,5, and demonstrates that the growth of the TRAPPIST-1 planets was complete in just a few million years, roughly an order of magnitude faster than that of the Earth6,7. Our results imply that any large water reservoirs on the TRAPPIST-1 planets must have been incorporated during their formation in the gaseous disk.},

Here we test the dynamical stability of co-orbital rings of planets perturbed by outside forces. We test two setups: i) 'stationary' rings of planets that, when unperturbed, remain equally-spaced along their orbit; and ii) horseshoe constellation systems, in which planets are continually undergoing horseshoe librations with their immediate neighbors. We show that a single rogue planet crossing the planets' orbit more massive than a few lunar masses (0.01-0.04 Earth masses) systematically disrupts a co-orbital ring of 6, 9, 18, or 42 Earth-mass planets located at 1 au. Stationary rings are more resistant to perturbations than horseshoe constellations, yet when perturbed they can transform into stable horseshoe constellation systems. Given sufficient time, any co-orbital ring system will be perturbed into either becoming a horseshoe constellation or complete destabilization.},

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1 b and c and for characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body code Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure computed with the code Burnman. Our simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state. Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a result, the substellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with periods varying from 55 years to 290 years depending on the planet.}},

  abstract = {The early evolution of Earth's atmosphere and the origin of life took place at a time when physical conditions at the Earth were radically different from its present state. The radiative input from the Sun was much enhanced in the high-energy spectral domain, and in order to model early planetary atmospheres in detail, a knowledge of the solar radiative input is needed. We present an investigation of the atmospheric parameters, state of evolution, and high-energy fluxes of the nearby star {$\kappa$}1 Cet, previously thought to have properties resembling those of the early Sun. Atmospheric parameters were derived from the excitation/ionization equilibrium of Fe i and Fe ii, profile fitting of H{$\alpha$}, and the spectral energy distribution. The UV irradiance was derived from Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope data, and the absolute chromospheric flux from the H{$\alpha$} line core. From careful spectral analysis and the comparison of different methods, we propose for {$\kappa$}1 Cet the following atmospheric parameters: Teff = 5665 {\textpm} 30 K (H{$\alpha$} profile and energy distribution), log g = 4.49 {\textpm} 0.05 dex (evolutionary and spectroscopic), and [Fe/H] = +0.10 {\textpm} 0.05 (Fe ii lines). The UV radiative properties of {$\kappa$}1 Cet indicate that its flux is some 35\% lower than the current Sun's between 210 and 300 nm, it matches the Sun's at 170 nm, and increases to at least 2--7 times higher than the Sun's between 110 and 140 nm. The use of several indicators ascribes an age to {$\kappa$}1 Cet in the interval {$\sim$}0.4--0.8 Gyr and the analysis of the theoretical Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (H--R) suggests a mass {$\sim$}1.04 M{$\Sun$}. This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on Earth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water. Photochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a significant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly assumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the chemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the stronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES instrument was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperate rocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. The broad wavelength coverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to assess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral information to help characterise the stellar targets. The CARMENES Data Release 1 (DR1) makes public all observations obtained during the CARMENES guaranteed time observations, which ran from 2016 to 2020 and collected 19,633 spectra for a sample of 362 targets. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70\% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18,642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44+/-0.20 planets with 1 M\_Earth {$<$} M sin i {$<$} 1000 M\_Earth and 1 d {$<$} P\_orb {$<$} 1000 d per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions as well as for additional applications, such as the determination of stellar properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Knowing the high-energy radiation environment of a star over a planet's formation and evolutionary period is critical in determining if that planet is potentially habitable and if any biosignatures could be detected, as UV radiation can severely change or destroy a planet's atmosphere. Current efforts for finding a potentially habitable planet are focused on M stars, yet K stars may offer more habitable conditions due to decreased stellar activity and more distant and wider habitable zones (HZs). While M star activity evolution has been observed photometrically and spectroscopically, there has been no dedicated investigation of K star UV evolution. We present the first comprehensive study of the near-UV, far-UV, and X-ray evolution of K stars. We used members of young moving groups and clusters ranging in age from 10 to 625 Myr combined with field stars and their archived GALEX UV and ROSAT X-ray data to determine how the UV and X-ray radiation evolve. We find that the UV and X-ray flux incident on an HZ planet is 5--50 times lower than that of HZ planets around early-M stars and 50--1000 times lower than those around late-M stars, due to both an intrinsic decrease in K dwarf stellar activity occurring earlier than for M dwarfs and the more distant location of the K dwarf HZ.},

  abstract = {Low-mass stars ({$\leq$}1 M {$\odot$}) are some of the best candidates for hosting planets with detectable life because of these stars' long lifetimes and relative ratios of planet to star mass and radius. An important aspect of these stars to consider is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation incident on planets in the habitable zones due to the ability of UV and X-ray radiation to alter the chemistry and evolution of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we build on the results of the HAZMAT I and HAZMAT III M-star studies to determine the intrinsic UV and X-ray flux evolution with age for M stars using Gaia parallactic distances. We then compare these results to the intrinsic fluxes of K stars adapted from HAZMAT V. We find that although the intrinsic M-star UV flux is 10--100 times lower than that of K stars, the UV fluxes in their respective habitable zone are similar. However, the habitable zone X-ray flux evolutions are slightly more distinguishable with a factor of 3--15 times larger X-ray flux for late M stars than for K stars. These results suggest that there may not be a K-dwarf advantage compared to M stars in the UV, but one may still exist in the X-ray.},

  abstract = {Given that the macromolecular building blocks of life were likely produced photochemically in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light, we identify some general constraints on which stars produce sufficient UV for this photochemistry. We estimate how much light is needed for the UV photochemistry by experimentally measuring the rate constant for the UV chemistry (``light chemistry'', needed for prebiotic synthesis) versus the rate constants for the bimolecular reactions that happen in the absence of the UV light (``dark chemistry''). We make these measurements for representative photochemical reactions involving  SO32-  and HS-. By balancing the rates for the light and dark chemistry, we delineate the ``abiogenesis zones'' around stars of different stellar types based on whether their UV fluxes are sufficient for building up this macromolecular prebiotic inventory. We find that the  SO32-  light chemistry is rapid enough to build up the prebiotic inventory for stars hotter than K5 (4400 K). We show how the abiogenesis zone overlaps with the liquid water habitable zone. Stars cooler than K5 may also drive the formation of these building blocks if they are very active. The HS- light chemistry is too slow to work even for early Earth.},

  abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) light has long been invoked as a source of energy for prebiotic chemical synthesis, but experimental support does not involve sources of UV light that look like the young Sun. Here we experimentally investigate whether the UV flux available on the surface of early Earth, given a favorable atmosphere, can facilitate a variety of prebiotic chemical syntheses. We construct a solar simulator for the UV light of the faint young Sun on the surface of early Earth, called StarLab. We then attempt a series of reactions testing different aspects of a prebiotic chemical scenario involving hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sulfites, and sulfides under the UV light of StarLab, including hypophosphite oxidation by UV light and hydrogen sulfide, photoreduction of HCN with bisulfite, the photoanomerization of {$\alpha$}-thiocytidine, the production of a chemical precursor of a potentially prebiotic activating agent (nitroprusside), the photoreduction of thioanhydrouridine and thioanhydroadenosine, and the oxidation of ethanol (EtOH) by photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals. We compare the output of StarLab to the light of the faint young Sun to constrain the timescales over which these reactions would occur on the surface of early Earth. We predict that hypophosphite oxidation, HCN reduction, and photoproduction of nitroprusside would all operate on the surface of early Earth in a matter of days to weeks. The photoanomerization of {$\alpha$}-thiocytidine would take months to complete, and the production of oxidation products from hydroxyl radicals would take years. The photoreduction of thioanhydrouridine with hydrogen sulfide did not succeed even after a long period of irradiation, providing a lower limit on the timescale of several years. The photoreduction of thioanhydroadenosine with bisulfite produced 2{$\prime$}-deoxyriboadenosine (dA) on the timescale of days. This suggests the plausibility of the photoproduction of purine deoxyribonucleotides, such as the photoproduction of simple sugars, proceeds more efficiently in the presence of bisulfite.},

I show what tests can be applied to the UV-driven cyanosulfidic scenario and how the application of some of these tests has already falsified certain versions of this scenario. Testing initial conditions replaces certain reactants with others and affects the overall chemical network underlying the cyanosulfidic scenario. The sequence of reactions the scenario invokes can provide a predicted upper limit on the ubiquity of life in the universe.

  abstract = {Glint, the specular reflection of sunlight off Earth's oceans, may reveal the presence of oceans on an extrasolar planet. As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases, the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the fraction of the illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases. Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase. However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption. Here, we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100\% brighter at crescent phases than simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope paired with an external occulter.},

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500{\textasciitilde}nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05\{{\textbackslash}deg\} in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10{\textasciitilde}nm, and a temporal resolution of 1{\textasciitilde}day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.},

  abstract = {Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming few years. While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.},

  abstract = {The radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets has recently been shown to be bimodal. The photoevaporation model predicted this bimodality. In the photoevaporation scenario, some planets are completely stripped of their primordial H/He atmospheres, whereas others retain them. Comparisons between the photoevaporation model and observed planetary populations have the power to unveil details of the planet population inaccessible by standard observations, such as the core mass distribution and core composition. In this work, we present a hierarchical inference analysis on the distribution of close-in exoplanets using forward-models of photoevaporation evolution. We use this model to constrain the planetary distributions for core composition, core mass and initial atmospheric mass fraction. We find that the core-mass distribution is peaked, with a mean-mass of \${\textbackslash}backslashsim 6\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}backslashoplus\$. The bulk core-composition is consistent with a rock/iron mixture that is ice-poor and "Earth-like"; the spread in core-composition is found to be narrow (\${\textbackslash}backslashlesssim 16{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ variation in iron-mass fraction at the 2\${\textbackslash}backslashsigma\$ level) and consistent zero. This result favours core formation in a water/ice poor environment. We find the majority of planets accreted a H/He envelope with a typical mass fraction of \${\textbackslash}backslashsim 4{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$; only a small fraction did not accrete large amounts of H/He and were "born-rocky". We find four-times as many super-Earths were formed through photoevaporation, as formed without a large H/He atmosphere. Finally, we find core-accretion theory over-predicts the amount of H/He cores would have accreted by a factor of \${\textbackslash}backslashsim 5\$, pointing to additional mass-loss mechanisms (e.g. "boil-off") or modifications to core-accretion theory.},

However, it is unclear which of these two mechanisms dominates the atmospheric mass-loss which is likely sculpting the radius gap. In this work, we propose a new method of differentiating between the two models, which relies on analysing the radius gap in 3D parameter space. Using models for both mechanisms, and by performing synthetic transit surveys we predict the size and characteristics of a survey capable of discriminating between the two models. We find that a survey of \${\textbackslash}backslashgtrsim 5 000\$ planets, with a wide range in stellar mass and measurement uncertainties at a \${\textbackslash}backslashlesssim 5{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ level is sufficient. Our methodology is robust against moderate false positive contamination of \${\textbackslash}backslashlesssim 10{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$. We perform our analysis on two surveys (which do not satisfy our requirements): the California Kepler Survey and the Gaia-Kepler Survey and find, unsurprisingly, that both data-sets are consistent with either model. We propose a hypothesis test to be performed on future surveys which can robustly ascertain which of the two mechanisms formed the radius gap, provided one dominates over the other.},

For planets \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciitilde}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, we find that sub-Neptunes retain atmospheric mass fractions that scale with planet mass and show that the resulting mass-radius relations are degenerate with results for `water-worlds' consisting of a 1:1 silicate-to-ice composition ratio. We further demonstrate that our derived mass-radius relation is in excellent agreement with the observed exoplanet population orbiting M-dwarfs and that planet mass and radii alone are insufficient to determine the composition of some sub-Neptunes. Finally, we highlight that current exoplanet demographics show an increase in the ratio of super-Earths to sub-Neptunes with both stellar mass (and therefore luminosity) and age, which are both indicative of thermally driven atmospheric escape processes. Therefore, such processes should not be ignored when making compositional inferences in the mass-radius diagram.},

We find that of systems with a close-in, small planet also host an outer giant, compared to for stars irrespective of small planet presence. This implies that small planet hosts may be enhanced in outer giant occurrences compared to all stars with 1.7{$\sigma$} significance. Conversely, we estimate that of cold giant hosts also host an inner small planet, compared to of stars irrespective of cold giant presence. We also find that more massive and close-in giant planets are not associated with small inner planets. Specifically, our sample indicates that small planets are less likely to have outer giant companions more massive than approximately 120 M {$\oplus$} and within 0.3--3 au, than to have less massive or more distant giant companions, with {$\sim$}2.2{$\sigma$} confidence. This implies that massive gas giants within 0.3--3 au may suppress inner small planet formation. Additionally, we compare the host-star metallicity distributions for systems with only small planets and those with both small planets and cold giants. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stars in our survey that only host small planets have a metallicity distribution that is consistent with the broader solar-metallicity-median sample, while stars that host both small planets and gas giants are distinctly metal rich with {$\sim$}2.3{$\sigma$} confidence.},

  abstract = {Proto-planetary discs, the birth environment of planets, are an example of a structure commonly found in astrophysics, accretion discs. Identifying the mechanism responsible for accretion is a long-standing problem, dating back several decades. The common picture is that accretion is a consequence of turbulence, with several instabilities proposed for its origin. While traditionally this field used to be a purely theoretical endeavour, the landscape is now changing thanks mainly to new observational facilities such as the ALMA radio interferometer. Thanks to large improvements in spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity (which have enabled the study of disc substructure, kinematics and surveys of large disc populations), multiple techniques have been devised to observationally measure the amount of turbulence in discs. This review summarises these techniques, ranging from attempts at direct detection of turbulence from line broadening, to more indirect approaches that rely on properties of the dust or consider the evolution of global disc properties (such as masses, radii and accretion rates) for large samples, and what their findings are. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that discs are in fact not as turbulent as thought one decade ago. On the other hand, direct detection of turbulence in some discs and the finite radial extent of dust substructures and in some cases the finite vertical extent strongly indicate that turbulence must be present at some level in proto-planetary discs. It is still an open question whether this amount of turbulence is enough to power accretion or if this is instead driven by other mechanisms, such as MHD winds.},

We observed 11 HST/WFC3 transits of GJ9827d and find an absorption feature at 1.4\${\textbackslash}mu\$m in its transit spectrum, which is best explained (at 3.39\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) by the presence of water in GJ9827d's atmosphere. We further show that this feature cannot be caused by unnoculted star spots during the transits by combining an analysis of the K2 photometry and transit light-source effect retrievals. We reveal that the water absorption feature can be similarly well explained by a small amount of water vapor in a cloudy H\$\_2\$/He atmosphere, or by a water vapor envelope on GJ9827d. Given that recent studies have inferred an important mass-loss rate (\${$>$}0.5{\textbackslash},\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$/Gyr) for GJ9827d making it unlikely to retain a H-dominated envelope, our findings highlight GJ9827d as a promising water world candidate that could host a volatile-dominated atmosphere. This water detection also makes GJ9827d the smallest exoplanet with an atmospheric molecular detection to date.},

  abstract = {The UV environment of a host star affects the photochemistry in the atmosphere, and ultimately the surface UV environment for terrestrial planets and therefore the conditions for the origin and evolution of life. We model the surface UV radiation environment for Earth-sized planets orbiting FGKM stars in the circumstellar Habitable Zone for Earth through its geological evolution. We explore four different types of atmospheres corresponding to an early-Earth atmosphere at 3.9 Gyr ago and three atmospheres covering the rise of oxygen to present-day levels at 2.0 Gyr ago, 0.8 Gyr ago, and modern Earth. In addition to calculating the UV flux on the surface of the planet, we model the biologically effective irradiance, using DNA damage as a proxy for biological damage. We find that a pre-biotic Earth (3.9 Gyr ago) orbiting an F0V star receives 6 times the biologically effective radiation as around the early Sun and 3520 times the modern Earth--Sun levels. A pre-biotic Earth orbiting GJ 581 (M3.5 V) receives 300 times less biologically effective radiation, about 2 times modern Earth--Sun levels. The UV fluxes calculated here provide a grid of model UV environments during the evolution of an Earth-like planet orbiting a range of stars. These models can be used as inputs into photo-biological experiments and for pre-biotic chemistry and early life evolution experiments.},

Alkaline hydrothermal springs---relieving the geophysical, thermal, and chemical disequilibria between oceans and tidally stressed crusts---could generate inorganic barriers to the otherwise uncontrolled and kinetically disfavored oxidation of hydrothermal hydrogen and methane. Ionic gradients imposed across these inorganic barriers, comprising iron oxyhydroxides and sulfides, could drive the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the oxidation of methane through thermodynamically favorable metabolic pathways leading to early life-forms. In such chemostatic environments, fuels may eventually outweigh oxidants. Ice-covered oceans are primarily heated from below, creating convection that could transport putative microbial cells and cellular cooperatives upward to congregate beneath an ice shell, potentially giving rise to a highly focused shallow biosphere. It is here where electron acceptors, ultimately derived from the irradiated surface, could be delivered to such life-forms through exchange with the icy surface. Such zones would act as ``electron disposal units'' for the biosphere, and occupants might be transferred toward the surface by buoyant diapirs and even entrained into plumes.

Detecting and studying these NIR bumps from nearby stars have been done mostly through infrared interferometry. In this work, we study the feasibility of detecting NIR bumps for Galactic bulge stars through microlensing from observations by The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (RST) survey. We first simulate microlensing light curves from source stars with discs in NIR. Four main conclusions can be extracted from the simulations. (i) If the lens is crossing the disc inner radius, two extra and wide peaks appear and the main peak of microlensing light curve is flattened. (ii) In microlensing events with the lens impact parameters larger than the disc inner radius, the disc can break the symmetry of light curves with respect to the time of closest approach. (iii) In caustic-crossing binary microlensing, the discs produce wide peaks right before entering and immediately after exiting from the caustic curves. (iv) The disc-induced perturbations are larger in the W149 filter than in the Z087 filter, unless the lens crosses the disc condensation radius. By performing a Monte Carlo simulation, the probabilities of detecting the disc perturbations by RST~are estimated {$\sim$}3 and 20~per\,cent in single and binary microlensing, respectively. We anticipate that RST~detects around 109 disc-induced perturbations during its microlensing survey if 5~per\,cent of its source stars have discs.},

The Roman~efficiency for detecting habitable planets is maximized for three classes of planetary microlensing events with close caustic topologies.

By assuming Jupiter-mass planets in the HZs, these events have q {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.001 and d {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.17 (q is their mass ratio and d is the projected planet-host distance on the sky plane normalized to the Einstein radius). The events with primary lenses, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, while their lens systems are either (b) close to the observer with Dl {$\lessequivlnt$} 1~kpc or (c) close to the Galactic bulge, Dl {$\greaterequivlnt$} 7~kpc. For Jupiter-mass planets in the HZs of the primary lenses, the events in these two classes have q {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.01, d {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.04. The events in the class (a) make larger caustics. By simulating planetary microlensing events detectable by Roman,~we conclude that the Roman~efficiencies for detecting Earth- and Jupiter-mass planets in the Optimistic HZs (OHZs, which is the region between [0.5, 2] au around a Sun-like star) are 0.01 and \$5\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$, respectively. If we assume that one exoplanet orbits each microlens in microlensing events detectable by Roman~(i.e. {$\sim$}27\,000),~this telescope has the potential to detect 35 exoplanets with the projected planet-host distances in the OHZs with only one having a mass {$\lessequivlnt$}10M{$\oplus$}. According to the simulation, 27 of these exoplanets are actually in the OHZs.},

  abstract = {The final orbital configuration of a planetary system is shaped by both its early star-disk environment and late-stage gravitational interactions. Assessing the relative importance of each of these factors is not straightforward due to the observed diversity of planetary systems compounded by observational biases. Our goal is to understand how a planetary system may change when planetesimal accretion and planet migrations stop and secular gravitational effects take over. Our approach starts with a novel classification of planetary systems based on their orbital architecture, validated using Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We apply this scheme to observed planetary systems and also to \${\textbackslash}sim 400\$ synthetic systems hosting \${\textbackslash}sim 5000\$ planets, synthesized from a Monte Carlo planet population model. Our classification scheme robustly yields four system classes according to their planet masses and semi-major axes, for both observed and synthetic systems. We then estimate the orbital distribution density of each of the synthetic systems before and after dynamically evolving them for up to 1 Myr with a gravitational+collisional \$N\$-body code. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to statistically measure orbital configuration changes, we find that \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of synthetic planetary systems experience such changes. We also find that this fraction belongs to a class of systems for which their center of mass is very close to their host star. Although changes in the orbital configuration of planetary systems may not very common, they are more likely to happen in systems with close-in, massive planets, with F- and G-type host-stars and stellar metallicities \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{[Fe/H]\} {$>$} 0.2\$.},

  abstract = {How the volatile content influences the primordial surface conditions of terrestrial planets and, thus, their future geodynamic evolution is an important question to answer. We simulate the secular convective cooling of a 1-D magma ocean (MO) in interaction with its outgassed atmosphere. The heat transfer in the atmosphere is computed either using the grey approximation or using a k-correlated method. We vary the initial CO2 and H2O contents (respectively from 0.1 {\texttimes} 10-2 to 14 {\texttimes} 10-2 wt \% and from 0.03 to 1.4 times the Earth Ocean current mass) and the solar distance---from 0.63 to 1.30 AU. A first rapid cooling stage, where efficient MO cooling and degassing take place, producing the atmosphere, is followed by a second quasi steady state where the heat flux balance is dominated by the solar flux. The end of the rapid cooling stage (ERCS) is reached when the mantle heat flux becomes negligible compared to the absorbed solar flux. The resulting surface conditions at ERCS, including water ocean's formation, strongly depend both on the initial volatile content and solar distance D. For D {$>$} DC, the ``critical distance,'' the volatile content controls water condensation and a new scaling law is derived for the water condensation limit. Although today's Venus is located beyond DC due to its high albedo, its high CO2/H2O ratio prevents any water ocean formation. Depending on the formation time of its cloud cover and resulting albedo, only 0.3 Earth ocean mass might be sufficient to form a water ocean on early Venus.},

  abstract = {Planetary atmospheres are commonly thought to result from the efficient outgassing of cooling magma oceans. During this stage, vigorous convective motions in the molten interior are believed to rapidly transport the dissolved volatiles to shallow depths where they exsolve and burst at the surface. This assumption of efficient degassing and atmosphere formation has important implications for both the early and long-term planetary evolution, but has never been tested against fluid dynamics considerations. Yet, during a convective cycle, only a finite fraction of the magma ocean can reach the shallow depths where oversaturated volatiles exsolution can occur, and a large-scale circulation can exist for vigorously convecting fluids in the presence of inertial effects. This can prevent a substantial magma ocean volume from rapidly reaching the planetary surface. Therefore, we conducted computational fluid dynamics experiments of vigorous 2D and 3D Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection at Prandtl number of unity to characterize the ability of the convecting fluid to reach shallow depths at which volatiles are exsolved and extracted to the atmosphere. We find that the outgassing efficiency is essentially a function of the magnitude of the convective velocities. This allows deriving simple expressions to predict the time evolution of the amount of outgassed volatiles as a function of the magma ocean governing parameters. We show that for plausible cases, the time required to exsolve all oversaturated water can exceed the magma ocean lifetime in a given highly vigorous transient stage, leading to incomplete or even negligible outgassing. Furthermore, the planet size and the initial magma ocean water content, through the convective vigor and the exsolution depth, respectively, strongly affect magma oceans degassing efficiency, possibly leading to divergent planetary evolution paths and resulting surface conditions. Overall, despite vigorous convection, for a significant range of parameters, convective degassing appears not as efficient as previously thought.},

  abstract = {Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase yield tight constraints on the planetary radius: from \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}=2.95{\textasciicircum}\{+2.69\}\_\{-1.95\}{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ without prior knowledge, to \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}=1.01{\textasciicircum}\{+0.33\}\_\{-0.19\}{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ with prior determination of the orbit for \${\textbackslash}rm\{SNR\}=20\$ in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}=0.98{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.14\}{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}=1.64{\textasciicircum}\{+1.29\}\_\{-0.80\}{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the SNR is more beneficial than additional prior observations.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. ESA's PLATO space mission, to be launched by the end of 2026, aims to detect and characterise Earth-like planets in their habitable zone using asteroseismology and the analysis of the transit events. The preparation of science objectives will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We developed a light-curve simulator named the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator (PSLS) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical PLATO targets, that is showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, PSLS also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the PLATO multi-telescope concept.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board and also simulate the quasi-regular updates of the aperture masks during the observations. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument point spread functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases of the mission. These corrected and simulated light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in PSLS. Simulation of the oscillations and granulation signals rely on current state-of-the-art stellar seismology.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below {$\sim$}20 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}Hz. The systematic errors level is found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. PSLS reproduces the main properties of expected PLATO light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the PLATO cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the PLATO mission.}}}}}}}},

We considered what types of observations outside the core surveys would most benefit from early definition, given 700 hours of mission time in the first two years of Roman's operation. We recommend that a survey of the Galactic plane be defined early, based on the broad range of stakeholders for such a survey, the added scientific value of a first pass to obtain a baseline for proper motions complementary to Gaia's, and the significant potential synergies with ground-based surveys, notably the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on Rubin. We also found strong motivation to follow a community definition process for ultra-deep observations with Roman.},

Aside from just signalling the presence of life, however, some biosignatures can contain information about the state that a planet's biosphere has achieved. This additional information can be used to measure what fractions of planets achieve certain key stages, corresponding to the advent of life, photosynthesis, multicellularity, and technological civilization. We forecast the uncertainties of each measurement for upcoming surveys, and outline the key factors that determine these uncertainties. Our approach is probabilistic and relies on large numbers of candidates rather than detailed examination of individual exoplanet spectra. The dependence on survey size, likeliness of the transition, and several measures of degrees of confidence are discussed, including discussion of geological false positives in biosignatures as well as how combining data from different missions can affect the inference. Our analysis should influence policy recommendations for future mission design and strategy to minimize the impact of measurement uncertainties.},

  abstract = {K2-18 is a nearby M2.5 dwarf, located at 34 pc and hosting a transiting planet that was first discovered by the K2 mission and later confirmed with Spitzer Space Telescope observations. With a radius of {$\sim$}2 R{$\oplus$} and an orbital period of {$\sim$}33 days, the planet lies in the temperate zone of its host star and receives stellar irradiation similar to that of Earth. Here we perform radial velocity follow-up observations with the visual channel of CARMENES with the goal of determining the mass and density of the planet. We measure a planetary semi-amplitude of Kb {$\sim$} 3.5 and a mass of Mb {$\sim$} 9 M{$\oplus$}, yielding a bulk density around . This indicates a low-mass planet with a composition consistent with a solid core and a volatile-rich envelope. A signal at 9 days was recently reported using radial velocity measurements taken with the HARPS spectrograph. This was interpreted as being due to a second planet. We see a weaker, time- and wavelength-dependent signal in the CARMENES data set and thus favor stellar activity for its origin. K2-18 b joins the growing group of low-mass planets detected in the temperate zone of M dwarfs. The brightness of the host star in the near-infrared makes the system a good target for detailed atmospheric studies with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Standard accretion disk models suggest that the snow line in the solar nebula migrated interior to the Earth's orbit in a late stage of nebula evolution. In this late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU from outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the question why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass being as small as 0.023\% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy pebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line assuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use a simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and radial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble accretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions presented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of terrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the strength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1 AU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while turbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos reside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023 wt\% only if the disk is compact ({$<$}100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and the snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2--4 Myr after disk formation. If the solar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved into icy planets of 1--10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow. If the proto-Earth contained water of {\textasciitilde}1 wt\% as might be suggested by the density deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was possible with weaker turbulence and with earlier ({$>$}0.5--2 Myr) snow-line migration.},

  abstract = {Future human missions to the Moon and Mars will require astronauts to perform science-focused surface exploration in complex geological environments. However, the scientific expertise required for these activities is uncommon in the astronaut corps. PANGAEA (Planetary ANalogue Geological and Astrobiological Exercise for Astronauts) is a field training course designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) that addresses the topics of geological and astrobiological planetary exploration. The course intends to impart the essential basic theoretical and practical knowledge of geology and astrobiology, in order to prepare astronauts for advanced mission specific training. Significant focus is given to skills in areas relevant to future missions, such as scientific decision-making, working with a remotely located science team, and efficient documentation. For this reason, although portions of the course are taught in classrooms, developing independent field skills in analogue geological environments is a key part of the training. Classroom and field lessons are tightly interwoven in the course structure with a time separation often of only hours between being introduced to a concept in the classroom and seeing it in the field. The course forms part of the basic and pre-assignment training for European astronauts and is open to trainees from all other agencies. PANGAEA has been running since 2016, with participants including ESA and NASA astronauts, and Roscosmos cosmonauts, as well as mission designers, operations personnel and engineers. The primary field sites selected for the course are Permo-Triassic sedimentary sequences in the Italian Dolomites, impact lithologies in the Ries Crater, Germany, a comprehensive suite of volcanic deposits in Lanzarote, Spain, and anorthosite outcrops in Lofoten, Norway. Each is used as a base to deliver the main learning sessions, respectively: 1) Earth geology, rock recognition and sedimentology on Earth and Mars, 2) Lunar geology and impact cratering, 3) volcanism on Earth, Moon, and Mars, and astrobiology 4) intrusive rocks and lunar primordial crustal evolution. The four sessions are designed to increase trainee autonomy in field geology by including guided or autonomously executed geological traverses and practicing of sampling techniques. Whilst PANGAEA's primary focus is astronaut training, where appropriate and complementary to this training, technologies being developed for future missions are used and tested by the trainees during geological traverses. This provides an opportunity to evaluate the performance of new equipment and software in analogue field environments, whilst also providing trainees with experience using technology that might support future missions.},

In this paper, we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water-rich atmosphere on GJ 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5 wt\% initial water in order to still retain a water-based atmosphere. We also determine the amount of O2 that can build up in the atmosphere as a result of hydrogen dissociation and loss. We find that the magma ocean absorbs at most {$\sim$}10\% of the O2 produced, whereas more than 90\% is lost to space through hydrodynamic drag. The most common outcome for GJ 1132b from our simulations is a tenuous atmosphere dominated by O2, though, for very large initial water abundances, atmospheres with several thousands of bars of O2 are possible. A substantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier H2 envelope or low XUV flux over the system's lifetime. A steam atmosphere would also imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on GJ 1132b. Further modeling is needed to study the evolution of CO2 or N2-rich atmospheres on GJ 1132b.},

  abstract = {Many protoplanetary discs are self-gravitating early in their lives. If they fragment under their own gravity, they form bound gaseous clumps which may evolve to become giant planets. Today, the fraction of discs that undergo fragmentation, and the frequency of conditions that may lead to giant planet formation via gravitational instability, is still unknown. We perform a population synthesis of discs from formation to dispersal. In varying the infall radius, we study the relationship of the early disc size with fragmentation. Furthermore, we investigate how stellar accretion heating affects the fragmentation fraction. We find that discs fragment only if they become sufficiently large early in their lives. This size depends sensitively on where mass is added to the discs during the collapse of their parent molecular cloud core. By choosing intermediate infall locations leading to a synthetic disc size distribution that is in agreement with the observed one, we find a fragmentation fraction between 0.1 and 11 \%, depending on the efficiency of stellar accretion heating of the discs. We conclude that the early disc size is mainly determined by the infall location during the collapse of the molecular cloud core and controls the population-wide frequency of fragmentation. Stellar accretion heating plays an important role for fragmentation and must be studied further. Our work is an observationally-informed step towards a prediction of the frequency of giant planet formation by gravitational instability. Upcoming observations and theoretical studies will deepen our understanding of the formation and early evolution of discs, eventually allowing to understand how infall, disc morphology, giant planet formation via gravitational instability, and the observed extrasolar planet population are linked.},

  abstract = {Sub-Neptune planets with radii smaller than Neptune (3.9 R {$\oplus$}) are the most common type of planet known to exist in the Milky Way, even though they are absent in the solar system. These planets can potentially have a large diversity of compositions as a result of different mixtures of rocky material, icy material, and gas accreted from a protoplanetary disk. However, the bulk density of a sub-Neptune, informed by its mass and radius alone, cannot uniquely constrain its composition; atmospheric spectroscopy is necessary. GJ 1214 b, which hosts an atmosphere that is potentially the most favorable for spectroscopic detection of any sub-Neptune, is instead enshrouded in aerosols (thus showing no spectroscopic features), hiding its composition from view at previously observed wavelengths in its terminator. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum from 2.8 to 5.1 {$\mu$}m that shows signatures of CO2 and CH4, expected at high metallicity. A model containing both these molecules is preferred by 3.3{$\sigma$} and 3.6{$\sigma$} as compared to a featureless spectrum for two different data analysis pipelines, respectively. Given the low signal-to-noise of the features compared to the continuum, however, more observations are needed to confirm the CO2 and CH4 signatures and better constrain other diagnostic features in the near-infrared. Further modeling of the planet's atmosphere, interior structure and origins will provide valuable insights about how sub-Neptunes like GJ 1214 b form and evolve.},

Here, we investigate the properties of inner super-Earths and outer giant planets that form according to a core accretion scenario. We study the mutual relations between these planet species in synthetic planetary systems and compare them to the observed exoplanet population.                                         Methods.               We invoked the Generation 3 Bern model of planet formation and evolution to simulate 1000 multi-planet systems.

Results.               The formation of warm super-Earths and cold Jupiters in the same system is enhanced compared to the individual appearances, although it is weaker than what has been proposed through observations. We attribute the discrepancy to warm and dynamically active giant planets that frequently disrupt the inner systems, particularly in high-metallicity environments. In general, a joint occurrence of the two planet types requires intermediate solid reservoirs in the originating protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, we find differences in the volatile content of planets in different system architectures and predict that high-density super-Earths are more likely to host an outer giant. This correlation can be tested observationally.},

  abstract = {Context.               State-of-the-art planet formation models are now capable of accounting for the full spectrum of known planet types. This comes at the cost of an increasing complexity of the models, which calls into question whether established links between their initial conditions and the calculated planetary observables are preserved.                                         Aims.               In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to investigate the relations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and their formation history.                                         Methods.               We trained a Gaussian mixture model on typical exoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to identify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation histories of the planets associated with them and pinpointed their differences. Using the cluster affiliation as labels, we trained a random forest classifier to predict planet species from properties of the originating protoplanetary disk.                                         Results.               Without presupposing any planet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population. They roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant planets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as ``icy cores''. These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the formation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy of {$>$}90\%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of planetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form only in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with purely analytical predictions. Including               N               -body interactions between the planets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that frequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths.                                         Conclusions.               The processes covered by current core accretion models of planet formation are largely predictable and reproduce the known demographic features in the exoplanet population. The impact of gravitational interactions highlights the need for               N               -body integrators for realistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets.},

  abstract = {We quantify the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation by examining the contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal atmospheres with adiabatic index (\${\textbackslash}backslashgamma=5/3\$) that the local atmospheric mass loss fraction for ground velocities \$v\_g {\textbackslash}textless 0.25 v\_\{esc\}\$ is given by \${\textbackslash}backslashchi\_\{loss\}=(1.71 v\_g/v\_\{esc\}){\textasciicircum}\{4.9\}\$, where \$v\_\{esc\}\$ is the escape velocity from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of the impactor velocity \$v\_\{Imp\}\$ and mass \$m\_\{Imp\}\$ and given by \$X\_\{loss\} {$\sim$} 0.4x+1.4x{\textasciicircum}2-0.8x{\textasciicircum}3\$ (isothermal atmosphere) and \$X\_\{loss\} {$\sim$} 0.4x+1.8x{\textasciicircum}2-1.2x{\textasciicircum}3\$ (adiabatic atmosphere), where \$x=(v\_\{Imp\}m/v\_\{esc\}M)\$. Atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) Large enough impactors \$m {\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}backslashsqrt\{2\} {\textbackslash}backslashrho\_0 ({\textbackslash}backslashpi h R){\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}\$ (25{$\sim$}km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, which is \$h/2R\$ of the whole atmosphere, where \$h\$, \$R\$ and \${\textbackslash}backslashrho\_0\$ are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 2) Smaller impactors, but above \$m{\textbackslash}textgreater4 {\textbackslash}backslashpi {\textbackslash}backslashrho\_0 h{\textasciicircum}3\$ (1{$\sim$}km for the current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimals. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets. (Abridged)},

Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.

The larger planet, GJ3470-d, was observed in a 14.9617-days orbit and the smaller planet, GJ3470-e, in a 14.9467-days orbit. GJ3470-d is sub-Jupiter size with a 1.4\% depth and a duration of 3 hours, 4 minutes. The smaller planet, GJ3470-e, currently leads the larger planet by approximately 1.146-days and is extending that lead by about 7.5-minutes (JD 0.0052) per orbital cycle. It has an average depth of 0.5\% and an average duration of 3 hours, 2 minutes. The larger planet, GJ3470-d, has been observed on seven separate occasions over a 3-year period, allowing for a very precise orbital period calculation. The last transit was observed by three separate observatories in Oklahoma and Arizona. The smaller planet, GJ3470-e, has been observed on five occasions over 2-years. Our data appears consistent with two exoplanets in a Horseshoe Exchange orbit. When confirmed, these will be the second and third exoplanets discovered and characterized by amateur astronomers without professional data or assistance. It will also be the first ever discovery of co-orbiting exoplanets in a Horseshoe Exchange orbit.},

  abstract = {Super-Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency and some will be able to retain stable H2-dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature gases in an H2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulfide and CH3Cl, are therefore more favorable in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH3 and N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH4 and H2S, are not effective signs of life in an H2-rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H2-rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

In this context, the TRAPPIST-1 planets form a unique benchmark system that has garnered the interest of a large scientific community.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The SPECULOOS survey is an exoplanet transit survey targeting a volume-limited (40 pc) sample of ultracool dwarf stars (of spectral type M7 and later) that is based on a network of robotic 1 m telescopes especially designed for this survey. The strategy for brighter and earlier targets leverages on the synergy with the ongoing TESS space-based exoplanet transit survey.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We define the SPECULOOS target list as the sum of three non-overlapping sub-programmes incorporating the latest type objects (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 3000 K). Programme 1 features 365 dwarfs that are small and near enough to make it possible to detail atmospheric characterisation of an `Earth-like' planet with the upcoming JWST. Programme 2 features 171 dwarfs of M5-type and later for which a significant detection of a planet similar to TRAPPIST-1b should be within reach of TESS. Programme 3 features 1121 dwarfs that are later than M6-type. These programmes form the basis of our statistical census of short-period planets around ultracool dwarf stars.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our compound target list includes 1657 photometrically classified late-type dwarfs, with 260 of these targets classified, for the first time, as possible nearby ultracool dwarf stars. Our general observational strategy was to monitor each target between 100 and 200 h with our telescope network, making efficient use of the synergy with TESS for our Programme 2 targets and a proportion of targets in our Programme 1.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we expect to detect up to a few dozen temperate, rocky planets. We also expect a number of them to prove amenable for atmospheric characterisation with JWST and other future giant telescopes, which will substantially improve our understanding of the planetary population of the latest-type stars.}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {In this work, the viability of the detection of methane produced by microbial activity in low-temperature hydrothermal vents on an Archean-Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone is explored via a simplified bottom-up approach using a toy model. By simulating methanogens at hydrothermal vent sites in the deep ocean, biological methane production for a range of substrate inflow rates was determined and compared to literature values. These production rates were then used, along with a range of ocean floor vent coverage fractions, to determine likely methane concentrations in the simplified atmosphere. At maximum production rates, a vent coverage of 4--15\,{\texttimes}\,10-4 \% (roughly 2000--6500 times that of modern Earth) is required to achieve 0.25\% atmospheric methane. At minimum production rates, 100\% vent coverage is not enough to produce 0.25\% atmospheric methane. NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator was then used to assess the detectability of methane features at various atmospheric concentrations. Even with future space-based observatory concepts (such as LUVOIR and HabEx), our results show the importance of both mirror size and distance to the observed planet. Planets with a substantial biomass of methanogens in hydrothermal vents can still lack a detectable, convincingly biological methane signature if they are beyond the scope of the chosen instrument. This work shows the value of coupling microbial ecological modeling with exoplanet science to better understand the constraints on biosignature gas production and its detectability.},

Visible/near-infrared and thermal-infrared synthetic spectra of these planets were generated to determine which biosignature gases might be observed by a future, space-based telescope. Our star sample included two observed active M dwarfs---AD Leo and GJ 643---and three quiescent model stars. The spectral distribution of these stars in the ultraviolet generates a different photochemistry on these planets. As a result, the biogenic gases CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl have substantially longer lifetimes and higher mixing ratios than on Earth, making them potentially observable by space-based telescopes. On the active M-star planets, an ozone layer similar to Earth's was developed that resulted in a spectroscopic signature comparable to the terrestrial one. The simultaneous detection of O2 (or O3) and a reduced gas in a planet's atmosphere has been suggested as strong evidence for life. Planets circling M stars may be good locations to search for such evidence. Key Words: Habitable planets---M dwarfs---Biosignatures---Biomarkers---Terrestrial Planet Finder.

  abstract = {Recent observations have uncovered a correlation between the accretion rates (measured from the UV continuum excess) of protoplanetary discs and their masses inferred from observations of the submm continuum. While viscous evolution models predict such a correlation, the predicted values are in tension with data obtained from the Lupus and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions; for example, they underpredict the scatter in accretion rates, particularly in older regions. Here, we argue that since the submm observations trace the discs' dust, by explicitly modelling the dust grain growth, evolution, and emission, we can better understand the correlation. We show that for turbulent viscosities with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-3, the depletion of dust from the disc due to radial drift means we can reproduce the range of masses and accretion rates seen in the Lupus and Upper Sco data sets. One consequence of this model is that the upper locus of accretion rates at a given dust mass does not evolve with the age of the region. Moreover, we find that internal photoevaporation is necessary to produce the lowest accretion rates observed. In order to replicate the correct dust masses at the time of disc dispersal, we favour relatively low photoevaporation rates {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-9~M{$\odot~$}yr-1 for most sources but cannot discriminate between EUV or X-ray-driven winds. A limited number of sources, particularly in Lupus, are shown to have higher masses than predicted by our models which may be evidence for variations in the properties of the dust or dust trapping induced in substructures.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary discs consist of gas and dust - the remnants of the star formation process - found around stars in the first few million years of their life. Photoevaporation, whereby high-energy radiation from the central star heats disc material causing it to flow away in a wind, is one process thought to contribute to their ultimate dispersal. Previous studies have failed to reach a consensus on the main radiation which is responsible for this process, variably finding the X-ray, Extreme Ultraviolet, or Far Ultraviolet. These paradigms make very different predictions for the amount of mass lost to the winds, and consequently how important they are for disc evolution. The primary aim of the thesis is to tackle this uncertainty from the following directions: a) by understanding the microphysical processes that underpin the differences in existing models in order to establish a comprehensive methodology for future state-of-the-art photoevaporation simulations that resolve the present disagreements; b) by considering how different wind models appear in observations of atomic forbidden emission lines and so how both line profiles and spatially resolved emission may be used to constrain the wind's nature; c) by including photoevaporation in models of disc evolution on secular timescales that predict its interplay with other processes - and how this manifests in disc demographic surveys - and thus determine how it contributes to the disc's ultimate dispersal. I conclude that while EUV-driven models have underestimated the role of X-ray due to a lack of detail in the spectrum, the X-ray driven models have underestimated the cooling from molecular emission lines. Thus; the true picture may be expected to be somewhat intermediate between the two extremes. Constraints from disc demographics require low enough rates that discs survive to the age of older star forming regions even around low-mass stars, and there is time for dust to deplete considerably before the wind disperses the gas. Conversely, ratios of emission lines require a high enough mass-loss rate to ensure the wind is only weakly ionised.},

  abstract = {Planets less massive than about 10 MEarth are expected to have no massive H--He atmosphere and a cometary composition ({$\sim$}50\% rocks, 50\% water, by mass) provided they formed beyond the snowline of protoplanetary disks. Due to inward migration, such planets could be found at any distance between their formation site and the star. If migration stops within the habitable zone, this may produce a new kind of planets, called ocean-planets. Ocean-planets typically consist in a silicate core, surrounded by a thick ice mantle, itself covered by a 100 km-deep ocean. The possible existence of ocean-planets raises important astrobiological questions: Can life originate on such body, in the absence of continent and ocean--silicate interfaces? What would be the nature of the atmosphere and the geochemical cycles? In this work, we address the fate of hot ocean-planets produced when migration ends at a closer distance. In this case the liquid/gas interface can disappear, and the hot H2O envelope is made of a supercritical fluid. Although we do not expect these bodies to harbor life, their detection and identification as water-rich planets would give us insight as to the abundance of hot and, by extrapolation, cool ocean-planets. The water reservoir of these planets seems to be weakly affected by gravitational escape, provided that they are located beyond some minimum distance, e.g. 0.04 AU for a 5-Earth-mass planet around a Sun-like star. The swelling of their water atmospheres by the high stellar flux is expected not to significantly increase the planets' radii. We have studied the possibility of detecting and characterizing these hot ocean-planets by measuring their mean densities using transit missions in space---CoRoT (CNES) and Kepler (NASA)---in combination with Doppler velocimetry from the ground---HARPS (ESO) and possible future instruments. We have determined the domain in the [stellar magnitude, orbital distance] plane where discrimination between ocean-planets and rocky planets is possible with these instruments. The brightest stars of the mission target lists and the planets closest to their stars are the most favorable cases. Full advantage of high precision photometry by CoRoT, and particularly Kepler, can be obtained only if a new generation of Doppler instruments is built.},

This was, however, a consequence of assuming a fully convective structure2--11. Here, we report using a consistent climate model that pure steam atmospheres are commonly shaped by radiative layers, making their thermal structure strongly dependent on the stellar spectrum and internal heat flow. The surface is cooler when an adiabatic profile is not imposed; melting Earth's crust requires an insolation several times higher than today, which will not happen during the main sequence of the Sun. Venus's surface can solidify before the steam atmosphere escapes, which is the opposite of previous works4,5. Around the reddest stars (Teff\,\,{$<$}\,\,3,000\,K), surface magma oceans cannot form by stellar forcing alone, whatever the water content. These findings affect observable signatures of steam atmospheres and exoplanet mass--radius relationships, drastically changing current constraints on the water content of TRAPPIST-1 planets. Unlike adiabatic structures, radiative--convective profiles are sensitive to opacities. New measurements of poorly constrained high-pressure opacities, in particular far from the H2O absorption bands, are thus necessary to refine models of steam atmospheres, which are important stages in terrestrial planet evolution.},

Understanding the chemical interactions between water and Mg-silicates or iron is essential for constraining the interiors of water-rich planets. Hydration effects have, however, been mostly neglected by the astrophysics community so far. As such effects are unlikely to have major impacts on theoretical mass-radius relations, this is justified as long as the measurement uncertainties are large. However, upcoming missions, such as the PLATO mission (scheduled launch 2026), are envisaged to reach a precision of up to {$\approx$}3 and {$\approx$}10\% for radii and masses, respectively. As a result, we may soon enter an area in exoplanetary research where various physical and chemical effects such as hydration can no longer be ignored.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our goal is to construct interior models for planets that include reliable prescriptions for hydration of the cores and mantles. These models can be used to refine previous results for which hydration has been neglected and to guide future characterization of observed exoplanets.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We have developed numerical tools to solve for the structure of multi-layered planets with variable boundary conditions and compositions. Here we consider three types of planets: dry interiors, hydrated interiors, and dry interiors plus surface ocean, where the ocean mass fraction corresponds to the mass fraction of the H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O equivalent in the hydrated case.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find H and OH storage capacities in the hydrated planets equivalent to 0-6 wt\% H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O corresponding to up to {$\approx$}800 km deep ocean layers.

Considerations of environmental supply and organismal demand of energy lead to the conclusions that power units are most appropriate and that the units for habitability become watts per organism. Extreme and plush environments are revealed to be on a habitability continuum, and extreme environments can be quantified as those where power supply only barely exceeds demand. Strategies for laboratory and field experiments are outlined that would quantify power supplies, power demands, and habitability. An example involving a comparison of various metabolisms pursued by halophiles is shown to be well on the way to a quantitative habitability analysis.},

  abstract = {Mildly irradiated mini-Neptunes have densities potentially consistent with them hosting substantial liquid-water oceans ("Hycean" planets). The presence of CO2 and simultaneous absence of ammonia (NH3) in their atmospheres has been proposed as a fingerprint of such worlds. JWST observations of K2-18b, the archetypal Hycean, have found the presence of CO2 and the depletion of NH3 to {$<$}100 ppm; hence, it has been inferred that this planet may host liquid-water oceans. In contrast, climate modeling suggests that many of these mini-Neptunes, including K2-18b, may likely be too hot to host liquid water. We propose a solution to this discrepancy between observation and climate modeling by investigating the effect of a magma ocean on the atmospheric chemistry of mini-Neptunes. We demonstrate that atmospheric NH3 depletion is a natural consequence of the high solubility of nitrogen species in magma at reducing conditions; precisely the conditions prevailing where a thick hydrogen envelope is in communication with a molten planetary surface. The magma ocean model reproduces the present JWST spectrum of K2-18b to {$\lessequivlnt$}3{$\sigma$}, suggesting this is as credible an explanation for current observations as the planet hosting a liquid-water ocean. Spectral areas that could be used to rule out the magma ocean model include the {$>$}4 {$\mu$}m region, where CO2 and CO features dominate: magma ocean models suggest a systematically lower CO2/CO ratio than estimated from free-chemistry retrieval, indicating that deeper observations of this spectral region may be able to distinguish between oceans of liquid water and magma on mini-Neptunes.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We characterise the catalogue through comparisons to the full data release, external catalogues, and simulations. We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Theselection of objects within 100 pc from the full catalogue used selected training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and solution quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric solution is reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric data, quality flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated distance posterior probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock catalogues to define priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero probability of being within 100 pc is included in the catalogue.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We have produced a catalogue of 331 312 objects that we estimate contains at least 92\% of stars of stellar type M9 within 100 pc of the Sun. We estimate that 9\% of the stars in this catalogue probably lie outside 100 pc, but when the distance probability function is used, a correct treatment of this contamination is possible. We produced luminosity functions with a high signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. We examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white dwarf population, and wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all three samples. We detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters, and halo objects, in which we identified 12 members of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Enceladus. We present the first direct parallaxes of five objects in multiple systems within 10 pc of the Sun.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We provide the community with a large, well-characterised catalogue of objects in the solar neighbourhood.

  abstract = {No two rocky bodies offer a better laboratory for exploring the conditions controlling interior dynamics than Venus and Earth. Their similarities in size, density, distance from the sun, and young surfaces would suggest comparable interior dynamics. Although the two planets exhibit some of the same processes, Venus lacks Earth's dominant process for losing heat and cycling volatiles between the interior and the surface and atmosphere: plate tectonics. One commonality is the size and number of mantle plume features which are inferred to be active today and arise at the core mantle boundary. Such mantle plumes require heat loss from the core, yet Venus lacks a measurable interior dynamo. There is evidence for plume-induced subduction on Venus, but no apparent mosaic of moving plates. Absent plate tectonics, one essential question for interior dynamics is how did Venus obtain its young resurfacing age? Via catastrophic or equilibrium processes? Related questions are how does it lose heat via past periods of plate tectonics, has it always had a stagnant lid, or might it have an entirely different mode of heat loss? Although there has been no mission dedicated to surface and interior processes since the Magellan mission in 1990, near infrared surface emissivity data that provides information on the iron content of the surface mineralogy was obtained fortuitously from Venus Express. These data imply both the presence of continental-like crust, and thus formation in the presence of water, and recent volcanism at mantle hotspots. In addition, the study of interior dynamics for both Earth and exoplanets has led to new insights on the conditions required to initiate subduction and develop plate tectonics, including the possible role of high temperature lithosphere, and a renewed drive to reveal why Venus and Earth differ. Here we review current data that constrains the interior dynamics of Venus, new insights into its interior dynamics, and the data needed to resolve key questions.},

The three point-sources have continued to be absent in telescope exposures during 71 years with detection thresholds of {\textasciitilde}21st mag. We obtained two deep exposures with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias on 25 and 27 April 2023 in r and g-band, both reaching magnitude 25.5 (3-sigma). The three point-sources are still absent, implying they have dimmed by more than 10 magnitudes within an hour. When bright in 1952, the most isolated transient source has a profile nearly the same as comparison stars, implying the sources are sub-arcsec in angular size and they exhibit no elongation due to movement. This triple transient has observed properties similar to other cases where groups of transients ("multiple transients") have appeared and vanished in a small region within a plate exposure. The explanation for these three transients and the previously reported cases remains unclear. Models involving background objects that are optically luminous for less than one hour coupled with foreground gravitational lensing seem plausible. If so, a significant population of massive objects with structure serving as the lenses, to produce three images, are required to explain the hundreds of sub-hour transients.},

  abstract = {We present an extended analytical model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between \${\textbackslash}Lambda = 0\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ times the observed value, \${\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at \${\textbackslash}sim\$\,27 per\,cent for \$0.01 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}Lambda /{\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star formation efficiency for lower and higher values of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ is driven, respectively, by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ increases, falling below 5 per\,cent only for \${\textbackslash}Lambda {\textbackslash}gt 100 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$, the median posterior value of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ is \$539 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$. Furthermore, the probability of observing \${\textbackslash}Lambda {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$ is only 0.5 per\,cent. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with \${\textbackslash}Lambda {\textbackslash}lt 0\$, the indication is thus that \${\textbackslash}Lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble.

  abstract = {A long-term goal of exoplanet studies is the identification and detection of biosignature gases. Beyond the most discussed biosignature gas O2, only a handful of gases have been considered in detail. In this study, we evaluate phosphine (PH3). On Earth, PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as such, it is a potential biosignature gas in anoxic exoplanets. We simulate the atmospheres of habitable terrestrial planets with CO2- and H2-dominated atmospheres and find that PH3 can accumulate to detectable concentrations on planets with surface production fluxes of 1010 to 1014 cm-2 s-1 (corresponding to surface concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of ppm), depending on atmospheric composition and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. While high, the surface flux values are comparable to the global terrestrial production rate of methane or CH4 (1011 cm-2 s-1) and below the maximum local terrestrial PH3 production rate (1014 cm-2 s-1). As with other gases, PH3 can more readily accumulate on low-UV planets, for example, planets orbiting quiet M dwarfs or with a photochemically generated UV shield. PH3 has three strong spectral features such that in any atmosphere scenario one of the three will be unique compared with other dominant spectroscopic molecules. Phosphine's weakness as a biosignature gas is its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing rates for detectability. We calculate that tens of hours of JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) time are required for a potential detection of PH3. Yet, because PH3 is spectrally active in the same wavelength regions as other atmospherically important molecules (such as H2O and CH4), searches for PH3 can be carried out at no additional observational cost to searches for other molecular species relevant to characterizing exoplanet habitability. Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known abiotic false positives on terrestrial planets from any source that could generate the high fluxes required for detection.},

  abstract = {Cool M dwarfs within a few tens of parsecs from the Sun are becoming the focus of dedicated observational programs in the realm of exoplanet astrophysics. Gaia, in its all-sky survey of \&gt;109 objects, will deliver precision astrometry for a magnitude-limited (V~=~20) sample of M dwarfs. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between the Gaia astrometric data on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for planet detection and characterization. We carry out numerical simulations to gauge the Gaia potential for precision astrometry of exoplanets orbiting a sample of known dM stars within~{$\sim$}30\,pc from the Sun. We express Gaia detection thresholds as a function of system parameters and in view of the latest mission profile, including the most up-to-date astrometric error model. Our major findings are as follows: (1) it will be possible to accurately determine orbits and masses for Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods in the range 0.2~{$\lessequivlnt~$}P~{$\lessequivlnt~$}6.0~yr and with an astrometric signal-to-noise ratio {$\varsigma$}/{$\sigma$}AL~{$\greaterequivlnt~$}10. Given present-day estimates of the planet fraction fp around M dwarfs, {$\approx$}102 giant planets could be found by Gaia around the sample. Comprehensive screening by Gaia of the reservoir of~{$\sim$}4~{\texttimes}~105 M dwarfs within 100\,pc could result in~{$\sim$}2600 detections and as many as~{$\sim$}500 accurate orbit determinations. The value of fp could then be determined with an accuracy of 2~per\,cent, an improvement by over an order of magnitude with respect to the most precise values available to-date; (2) in the same period range, inclination angles corresponding to quasi-edge-on configurations will be determined with enough precision (a few~per\,cent) so that it will be possible to identify intermediate-separation planets which are potentially transiting within the errors. Gaia could alert us of the existence of 10 such systems. More than 250 candidates could be identified assuming solutions compatible with transit configurations within 10~per\,cent accuracy, although a large fraction of these ({$\sim$}85~per\,cent) could be false positives; (3) for well-sampled orbits, the uncertainties on planetary ephemerides, separation {$\varrho$} and position angle {\textvartheta} will degrade at typical rates of {$\Delta\varrho~\&$}lt;~1~mas~yr-1 and {$\Delta\vartheta~\&$}lt;~2{$^\circ~$}yr-1, respectively. These are over an order of magnitude smaller than the degradation levels attained by present-day ephemerides predictions based on mas-level precision Hubble Space Telescope/Fine Guidance Sensor astrometry; (4) planetary phases will be measured with typical uncertainties {$\Delta\lambda$} of several degrees, resulting (under the assumption of purely scattering atmospheres) in phase-averaged errors on the phase function {$\Delta\Phi$}({$\lambda$}) {$\approx$} 0.05, and expected uncertainties in the determination of the emergent flux of intermediate-separation (0.3~\&lt;~a~\&lt;~2.0~au) giant planets of~{$\sim$}20~per\,cent. Our results help to quantify the actual relevance of the Gaia astrometric observations of the large sample of nearby M dwarfs in a synergetic effort to optimize the planning and interpretation of follow-up/characterization measurements of the discovered systems by means of transit survey programs, and upcoming and planned ground-based as well as space-borne observatories for direct imaging (e.g. Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research, European Extremely Large Telescope/Planetary Camera and Spectrograph) and simultaneous multiwavelength spectroscopy (e.g. Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory, James Webb Space Telescope).},

Probing their atmospheric composition and physical characteristics is particularly valuable, as it allows for direct comparisons with the Solar system giant planets. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between Gaia astrometry and other ground-based and space-borne programs for detection and characterization of such companions. We carry out numerical simulations of Gaia observations of systems with one cold transiting gas giant, using Jovian planets around a sample of nearby low-mass stars as proxies. Using state-of-the-art orbit fitting tools, we gauge the potential of Gaia astrometry to predict the time of transit centre Tc for the purpose of follow-up observations to verify that the companions are indeed transiting. Typical uncertainties on Tc will be on the order of a few months, reduced to several weeks for high astrometric signal-to-noise ratios and periods shorter than {$\sim$}3\,yr. We develop a framework for the combined analysis of Gaia astrometry and radial-velocity data from representative ground-based campaigns and show that combined orbital fits would allow to significantly reduce the transit windows to be searched for, down to about {\textpm}2 weeks (2--{$\sigma$} level) in the most favourable cases. These results are achievable with a moderate investment of observing time ({$\sim$}0.5 nights per candidate, {$\sim$}50 nights for the top 100 candidates), reinforcing the notion that Gaia astrometric detections of potentially transiting cold giant planets, starting with Data Release 4, will constitute a valuable sample worthy of synergistic follow-up efforts with a variety of techniques.},

So too will the fraction of events with measurable higher order information, such as finite-source effects and lens--source relative proper motion. Analysing such data requires a more sophisticated Galactic microlens modelling approach. We present a new second-generation Manchester--Besan{\c c}on Microlensing Simulator (MaB{$\mu$}lS-2), which uses a version of the Besan{\c c}on population synthesis Galactic model that provides good agreement with stellar kinematics observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) towards the bulge. MaB{$\mu$}lS-2 provides high-fidelity signal-to-noise limited maps of the microlensing optical depth, rate and average time-scale towards a 400~deg2 region of the Galactic bulge in several optical to near-infrared pass-bands. The maps take full account of the unresolved stellar background, as well as limb-darkened source profiles. Comparing MaB{$\mu$}lS-2 with the efficiency-corrected OGLE-IV 8000 event sample shows a much improved agreement over the previous version of MaB{$\mu$}lS and succeeds in matching even small-scale structural features in the OGLE-IV event rate map. However, evidence remains for a small underprediction of the event rate per source and overprediction of the time-scale. MaB{$\mu$}lS-2 is available online (www.mabuls.net, Specht \&amp; Kerins) to provide on-the-fly maps for user-supplied cuts in survey magnitude, event time-scale and relative proper motion.},

It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

  abstract = {Life arose on Earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after the young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from young Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a Bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a Bayesian estimate of its posterior probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earth's history and that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact and considered its implications. We find that, given only this very limited empirical information, the choice of Bayesian prior for the abiogenesis probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior probability. Although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence that life might be abundant in the universe if early-Earth-like conditions are common, the evidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily low intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors. Finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on Earth, elsewhere in the solar system, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide much stronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the universe.},

  abstract = {The dozens of rocky exoplanets discovered in the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) currently represent the most suitable places to host life as we know it outside the Solar System. However, the presumed presence of liquid water on the CHZ planets does not guarantee suitable environments for the emergence of life. According to experimental studies, the building blocks of life are most likely produced photochemically in presence of a minimum ultraviolet (UV) flux. On the other hand, high UV flux can be life-threatening, leading to atmospheric erosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise questions about the actual habitability of CHZ planets around stars other than Solar-type ones, with different UV to bolometric luminosity ratios. By combining the "principle of mediocricy" and recent experimental studies, we define UV boundary conditions (UV-habitable Zone, UHZ) within which life can possibly emerge and evolve. We investigate whether exoplanets discovered in CHZs do indeed experience such conditions. By analysing Swift-UV/Optical Telescope data, we measure the near ultraviolet (NUV) luminosities of 17 stars harbouring 23 planets in their CHZ. We derive an empirical relation between NUV luminosity and stellar effective temperature. We find that eighteen of the CHZ exoplanets actually orbit outside the UHZ, i.e., the NUV luminosity of their M-dwarf hosts is decisively too low to trigger abiogenesis - through cyanosulfidic chemistry - on them. Only stars with effective temperature {$>$}3900 K illuminate their CHZ planets with enough NUV radiation to trigger abiogenesis. Alternatively, colder stars would require a high-energy flaring activity.},

Based upon the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, the refractive lens-based system provides an obstruction free optical path, which reduces the number of scattering surfaces and allows easier access to lower surface brightness levels. In this proceeding, we present an analysis of the impact of flat fielding uncertainty on the limiting low surface brightness levels. We show that a fairly standard set of flat-field data can be well-characterised to a \${\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ level. This corresponds to a 5-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ lower limit of \${\textbackslash}sim33\$ magnitude per arcsecond\${\textasciicircum}2\$, which means that flat fielding is not likely going to set Huntsman's low surface brightness limit. We also present early results of an exoplanet transient mode for Huntsman where all lenses work together to detect subtle variations in the luminosity of relatively bright \$V=8-12\$ magnitude stars. High-precision exoplanet imaging is ultimately limited by systematic uncertainties, so we anticipate multiple lenses will help to mitigate issues related to pixel-to-pixel and intra-pixel sensitivity variations. Our initial results show we can easily get \${\textbackslash}sim0.4{\textbackslash}\%\$ photometric precision with a single, defocused lens.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, large (sub-)millimetre surveys of protoplanetary disks have well constrained the demographics of disks, such as their millimetre luminosities, spectral indices, and disk radii. Additionally, several high-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in the disks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely due to pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics of these bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of this work is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties of protoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary- versus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas and dust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bump features. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtain synthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that the outermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across different millimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early ({$<$} 0.1 Myr), fast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived ({$>$} Myr) to obtain the observed high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. While the planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of the opacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bump model to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- over the zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planet formation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. The determination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bump also delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveys appear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths.},

Rapid formation of Jupiter's core within one million years after CAIs has been suggested as a potential mechanism for spatial and temporal separation. In this scenario, Jupiter's core would open a gap in the disk and trap inwards-drifting dust grains in the pressure bump at the outer edge of the gap, separating the inner and outer disk materials from each other. We performed simulations of dust particles in a protoplanetary disk with a gap opened by an early formed Jupiter core, including dust growth and fragmentation as well as dust transport using the dust evolution software DustPy. Our numerical experiments indicate that particles trapped in the outer edge of the gap rapidly fragment and are transported through the gap, contaminating the inner disk with outer disk materials on a timescale that is inconsistent with the meteoritic record. This suggests that other processes must have initiated or at least contributed to the isotopic separation between the inner and outer Solar System.},

  abstract = {The expected yield of potentially Earth-like planets is a useful metric for designing future exoplanet-imaging missions. Recent yield studies of direct-imaging missions have focused primarily on yield methods and trade studies using ``toy'' models of missions. Here, we increase the fidelity of these calculations substantially, adopting more realistic exoplanet demographics as input, an improved target list, and a realistic distribution of exozodi levels. Most importantly, we define standardized inputs for instrument simulations, use these standards to directly compare the performance of realistic instrument designs, include the sensitivity of coronagraph contrast to stellar diameter, and adopt engineering-based throughputs and detector parameters. We apply these new high-fidelity yield models to study several critical design trades: monolithic versus segmented primary mirrors (PMs), on-axis versus off-axis secondary mirrors, and coronagraphs versus starshades. We show that as long as the gap size between segments is sufficiently small ({$<$}0.1 \% of telescope diameter), there is no difference in yield for coronagraph-based missions with monolithic off-axis telescopes and segmented off-axis telescopes, assuming that the requisite engineering constraints imposed by the coronagraph can be met in both scenarios. We show that there is currently a factor of {$\sim$}2 yield penalty for coronagraph-based missions with on-axis telescopes compared to off-axis telescopes, and note that there is room for improvement in coronagraph designs for on-axis telescopes. We also reproduce previous results in higher fidelity, showing that the yields of coronagraph-based missions continue to increase with aperture size while the yields of starshade-based missions turnover at large apertures if refueling is not possible. Finally, we provide absolute yield numbers with uncertainties that include all major sources of astrophysical noise to guide future mission design.},

  abstract = {Using K2 data, we identified 23 very-low-mass members of the {$\rho$} Oph and Upper Scorpius star-forming region as having periodic photometric variability not easily explained by well-established physical mechanisms such as star spots, eclipsing binaries, or pulsation. All of these unusual stars are mid-to-late M dwarfs without evidence of active accretion, and with photometric periods generally {$<$}1 day. Often the unusual light-curve signature takes the form of narrow flux dips; when we also have rotation periods from star spots, the two periods agree, suggesting that the flux dips are due to material orbiting the star at the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We sometimes see ``state-changes'' in the phased light-curve morphologies where {$\sim$}25\% of the waveform changes shape on timescales less than a day; often, the ``state-change'' takes place immediately after a strong flare. For the group of stars with these sudden light-curve morphology shifts, we attribute their flux dips as most probably arising from eclipses of warm coronal gas clouds, analagous to the slingshot prominences postulated to explain transient H{$\alpha$} absorption features in AB Doradus and other rapidly rotating late-type stars. For another group of stars with somewhat longer periods, we find the short-duration flux dips to be highly variable on both short and long timescales, with generally asymmetric flux-dip profiles. We believe that these flux dips are due to particulate clouds possibly associated with a close-in planet or resulting from a recent collisional event.},

With BFDA, researchers can control the rate of misleading evidence but, in addition, they can plan for a target strength of evidence. BFDA can be applied to fixed-N and sequential designs. In this tutorial paper, we provide an introduction to BFDA and analyze how the use of informed prior distributions affects the results of the BFDA. We also present a user-friendly web-based BFDA application that allows researchers to conduct BFDAs with ease.

  abstract = {For the majority of short period exoplanets transiting massive stars with radiative envelopes, the spin angular momentum of the host star is greater than the planetary orbital angular momentum. In this case, the orbits of the planets will undergo nodal precession, which can significantly impact the probability that the planets transit their parent star. In particular, for some combinations of the spin-orbit angle \${\textbackslash}psi\$ and the inclination of the stellar spin \$i\_*\$, all such planets will eventually transit at some point over the duration of their precession period. Thus, as the time over which the sky has been monitored for transiting planets increases, the frequency of planets with detectable transits will increase, potentially leading to biased estimates of exoplanet occurrence rates, especially orbiting more massive stars. Furthermore, due to the dependence of the precession period on orbital parameters such as spin-orbit misalignment, the observed distributions of such parameters may also be biased. We derive the transit probability of a given exoplanet in the presence of nodal precession induced by a rapidly spinning host star. We find that the effect of nodal precession has already started to become relevant for some short-period planets, i.e., Hot Jupiters, orbiting massive stars, by increasing transit probabilities by of order a few percent for such systems within the original \$Kepler\$ field. We additionally derive simple expressions to describe the time evolution of the impact parameter \$b\$ for applicable systems, which should aid in future investigations of exoplanet nodal precession and spin-orbit alignment.},

However, the lack of discoveries of these planets beyond a few astronomical units from their host stars prompts a better understanding of their orbital architectures from their nascent birth cluster. Here, we perform stellar cluster simulations of 3-planet and 7-planet systems containing super-Earths on initially circular, coplanar orbits. We adopt the typical stellar masses of main-sequence progenitors of white dwarfs (\$1.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$-\$2.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) as host stars and include 8,000 main-sequence stars following a Kroupa initial mass function in our clusters. Our results reveal that about 30 per cent of the simulated planets generate eccentricities of at least 0.1 by the time of cluster dissolution, which would aid white dwarf pollution. We provide our output parameters to the community for potential use as initial conditions for subsequent evolution simulations.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Instrumental radial velocity (RV) precision has reached a level where the detection of planetary signals is limited by the ability to understand and simultaneously model stellar astrophysical ``noise.'' A common method for mitigating the effects of stellar activity is Gaussian process (GP) regression.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} In this study we present an analysis of the performance and properties of the quasi-periodic (QP) GP kernel, which is the multiplication of the squared-exponential kernel by the exponential-sine-squared kernel, based on an extensive set of synthetic RVs, into which the signature of activity was injected.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The stellar activity within our synthetic data sets was simulated using astrophysically motivated models with different spot distributions and spot lifetimes rotating on the surface of a modeled late-type star. We used dynamic nested sampling to fit different model sets, including QP--GPs, Keplerian models, white noise models, and combinations of these, to synthetic RV time series data that in some cases included additional injected planetary signals.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that while the QP--GP rotation parameter matches the simulated rotation period of the star, the length scale cannot be directly connected to the spot lifetimes on the stellar surface. Regarding the setup of the priors for the QP--GP, we find that it can be advantageous to constrain the QP--GP hyperparameters in different ways depending on the application and the goal of the analysis. We find that a constraint on the length scale of the QP--GP can lead to a significant improvement in identifying the correct rotation period of the star, while a constraint on the rotation hyperparameter tends to lead to improved planet detection efficiency and more accurately derived planet parameters. Even though for most of the simulations the Bayesian evidence performed as expected, we identified not far-fetched cases where a blind adoption of this metric would lead to wrong conclusions.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that modeling stellar astrophysical noise by using a QP--GP considerably improves detection efficiencies and leads to precise planet parameters. Nevertheless, there are also cases in which the QP--GP does not perform optimally, for example RV variations dynamically evolving on short timescales or a mixture of a very stable activity component and random variations. Knowledge of these limitations is essential for drawing correct conclusions from observational data.}}}}}},

The design addresses the 2011 Decadal Survey's recommendation for a New Frontiers class mission to Io and is based upon the result of the June 2012 NASA-JPL Planetary Science Summer School. A science payload is proposed to investigate the link between the structure of Io's interior, its volcanic activity, its surface composition, and its tectonics. A study of Io's atmospheric processes and Io's role in the Jovian magnetosphere is also planned. The instrument suite includes a visible/near-IR imager, a magnetic field and plasma suite, a dust analyzer, and a gimbaled high gain antenna to perform radio science. Payload activity and spacecraft operations would be powered by three Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRG). The primary mission includes 10 flybys with close-encounter altitudes as low as 100km. The mission risks are mitigated by ensuring that relevant components are radiation tolerant and by using redundancy and flight-proven parts in the design. The spacecraft would be launched on an Atlas V rocket with a delta-v of 1.3km/s. Three gravity assists (Venus, Earth, Earth) would be used to reach the Jupiter system in a 6-year cruise. The resulting concept demonstrates the rich scientific return of a flyby mission to Io.},

  abstract = {Core segregation and atmosphere formation are two of the major processes that redistribute the volatile elements-hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S)-in and around rocky planets during their formation. The volatile elements by definition accumulate in gaseous reservoirs and form atmospheres. However, under conditions of early planet formation, these elements can also behave as siderophiles (i.e., iron-loving) and become concentrated in core-forming metals. Current models of core formation suggest that metal-silicate reactions occurred over a wide pressure, temperature, and compositional space to ultimately impose the chemistries of the cores and silicate portions of rocky planets. Additionally, the solubilities of volatile elements in magmas determine their transfer between the planetary interiors and atmospheres, which has recently come into sharper focus in the context of highly irradiated, potentially molten exoplanets. Recently, there has been a significant push to experimentally investigate the metal-silicate and magma-gas exchange coefficients for volatile elements over a wide range of conditions relevant to rocky planet formation. Qualitatively, results from the metal-silicate partitioning studies suggest that cores of rocky planets could be major reservoirs of the volatile elements though significant amounts will remain in mantles. Results from solubility studies imply that under oxidizing conditions, most H and S are sequestered in the magma ocean, while most N is outgassed to the atmosphere, and C is nearly equally distributed between the atmosphere and the interior. Under reducing conditions, nearly all N dissolves in the magma ocean, the atmosphere becomes the dominant C reservoir, while H becomes more equally distributed between the interior and the atmosphere, and S remains dominantly in the interior.},

Understanding the atmospheres of these planets and determining the optimal strategy for characterizing them through transmission spectroscopy with our upcoming instrumentation is essential in order to constrain their environments. For this study, we present simulated transmission spectra of tidally locked Earth-sized ocean-covered planets around late-M to mid-K stellar spectral types, utilizing the results of general circulation models previously published by Kopparapu et al. as inputs for our radiative transfer calculations performed using NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator (psg.gsfc.nasa.gov). We identify trends in the depth of H2O spectral features as a function of planet surface temperature and rotation rate. These trends allow us to calculate the exposure times necessary to detect water vapor in the atmospheres of aquaplanets through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope as well as several future flagship space telescope concepts under consideration (the Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor and the Origins Space Telescope) for a target list constructed from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Input Catalog (TIC). Our calculations reveal that transmission spectra for water-rich Earth-sized planets around low-mass stars will be dominated by clouds, with spectral features {$<$}20 ppm, and only a small subset of TIC stars would allow for the characterization of an ocean planet in the habitable zone. We thus present a careful prioritization of targets that are most amenable to follow-up characterizations with next-generation instrumentation, in order to assist the community in efficiently utilizing precious telescope time.},

These short events are well modeled by a power-law mass function, \$dN\_4/d{\textbackslash}log M = (2.18{\textasciicircum}\{+0.52\}\_\{-1.40\}){\textbackslash}times (M/8{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\_4\}\$ dex\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$star\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}alpha\_4 = 0.96{\textasciicircum}\{+0.47\}\_\{-0.27\}\$ for \$M/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {$<$} 0.02\$.

  abstract = {Techniques to retrieve the atmospheric properties of exoplanets via direct observation of their reflected light have often been limited in scope due to computational constraints imposed by the forward-model calculations. We have developed a new set of techniques which significantly decreases the time required to perform a retrieval while maintaining accurate results. We constructed a grid of 1.4 million pre-computed geometric albedo spectra valued at discrete sets of parameter points. Spectra from this grid are used to produce models for a fast and efficient nested sampling routine called PSGnest. Beyond the upfront time to construct a spectral grid, the amount of time to complete a full retrieval using PSGnest is on the order of seconds to minutes using a personal computer. An extensive evaluation of the error induced from interpolating intermediate spectra from the grid indicates that this bias is insignificant compared to other retrieval error sources, with an average coefficient of determination between interpolated and true spectra of 0.998. We apply these new retrieval techniques to help constrain the optimal bandpass centers for retrieving various atmospheric and bulk parameters from a LuvEx-type mission observing several planetary archetypes. We show that spectral observations made using a 20{\textbackslash}\% bandpass centered at 0.73 microns can be used alongside our new techniques to make detections of \$H\_2O\$ and \$O\_2\$ without the need to increase observing time beyond what is necessary for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. The methods introduced here will enable robust studies of the capabilities of future observatories to characterize exoplanets.},

  abstract = {We compare the planet-to-star mass-ratio distribution measured by gravitational microlensing to core accretion theory predictions from population synthesis models. The core accretion theory's runaway gas accretion process predicts a dearth of intermediate-mass giant planets that is not seen in the microlensing results. In particular, the models predict {$\sim$} 10 {\texttimes} fewer planets at mass ratios of 10-4 {$\leq$} q {$\leq$} 4 {\texttimes} 10-4 than inferred from microlensing observations. This tension implies that gas giant formation may involve processes that have hitherto been overlooked by existing core accretion models or that the planet-forming environment varies considerably as a function of host-star mass. Variation from the usual assumptions for the protoplanetary disk viscosity and thickness could reduce this discrepancy, but such changes might conflict with microlensing results at larger or smaller mass ratios, or with other observations. The resolution of this discrepancy may have important implications for planetary habitability because it has been suggested that the runaway gas accretion process may have triggered the delivery of water to our inner solar system. So, an understanding of giant planet formation may help us to determine the occurrence rate of habitable planets.},

These two clusters follow strikingly different distributions in the period--radius parameter plane. The branch of sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets is censored by the orbital period at the large-radius end: no planets with mass between 0.02 and 0.8 MJ or with radius between 0.25 and 1.0 RJ are known with Porb {$<$} 2.5 days.

G-CLEF is vacuum enclosed and fiber-fed to enable precision radial velocity (PRV) measurements, especially for the detection and characterization of low-mass exoplanets orbiting solar-type stars. The passband of G-CLEF is broad, extending from 3500\&Aring; to 9500\&Aring;. This passband provides good sensitivity at blue wavelengths for stellar abundance studies and deep red response for observations of high-redshift phenomena. The design of G-CLEF incorporates several novel technical innovations. We give an overview of the innovative features of the current design. G-CLEF will be the first PRV spectrograph to have a composite optical bench so as to exploit that material's extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, high in-plane thermal conductivity and high stiffness-to-mass ratio. The spectrograph camera subsystem is divided into a red and a blue channel, split by a dichroic, so there are two independent refractive spectrograph cameras. The control system software is being developed in model-driven software context that has been adopted globally by the GMT. G-CLEF has been conceived and designed within a strict systems engineering framework. As a part of this process, we have developed a analytical toolset to assess the predicted performance of G-CLEF as it has evolved through design phases.},

Owing to the sensitivity limits of the currently used detection techniques, these planets populate zones restricted either to the solar neighbourhood or towards the galactic bulge. This selection problem prevents us from unveiling the true galactic planetary population and is not set to change for the next two decades. Here, we present a detection method that overcomes this issue and that will allow us to detect massive exoplanets using gravitational-wave astronomy. We show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission can characterize new circumbinary exoplanets orbiting white dwarf binaries everywhere in our Galaxy---a population of exoplanets so far completely unprobed---as well as detecting extragalactic bound exoplanets in the Magellanic Clouds. Such a method is not limited by stellar activity and, in extremely favourable cases, will allow LISA to detect planets down to 50\,Earth masses.},

We consider multiple approaches for simulating M3--T9 sources within the survey fields, including scaling local space densities and using Galactic stellar population synthesis models. These approaches independently predict {$\sim$}100,000 single mid-M dwarfs and UCDs brighter than a Roman F146 magnitude of 21 that are within the survey fields. Assuming planet occurrence statistics previously measured for early-to-mid-M dwarfs, we predict that the survey will discover small transiting planets around these sources, each to a significance of 7.1{$\sigma$} or greater. Significant departures from this prediction would test whether the occurrence rates of small planets increase or decrease around mid-M dwarfs and UCDs compared to early-M dwarfs. We predict the detection of habitable, terrestrial planets (R p {$<$} 1.23 R {$\oplus$}) in the survey. However, atmospheric characterization of these planets will be challenging with current or near-future space telescope facilities due to the faintness of the host stars. Nevertheless, accurate statistics for the occurrence of small planets around mid-M dwarfs and UCDs will enable direct tests of predictions from planet formation theories and will determine our understanding of planet demographics around the objects at the bottom of the main sequence. This understanding is critical given the prevalence of such objects in our galaxy, whose planets may therefore comprise the bulk of the galactic census of exoplanets.},

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of {$\asymp$}2.4\% in temperature, {$\asymp$}2.0\% in luminosity, and {$\asymp$}4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order {$\asymp$}5\% in mass and {$\asymp$}20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

In this work, we stack the phase-folded transits of 284 viable moon hosting Kepler planetary candidates, in order to search for satellites. These planets range from Earth- to Jupiter-sized and from {$\sim$}0.1 to 1.0 au in separation---so-called ``warm'' planets. Our data processing includes two-pass harmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection, and careful data quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with an rms of 5.1 ppm. We find that the occurrence rate of Galilean analog moon systems for planets orbiting between {$\sim$}0.1 and 1.0 au can be constrained to be to 95\% confidence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3\% confidence interval of . A single-moon model of variable size and separation locates a slight preference for a population of short-period moons with radii {$\sim$}0.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting at 5--10 planetary radii. However, we stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be treated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various physically motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of Galilean analogs around warm planets places the first strong constraint on exomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b I, which we briefly describe ahead of scheduled observations of the target with the Hubble Space Telescope.},

However, this initial phase of particle growth faces constraints, notably from destructive encounters. To find the maximum particle size achievable, we studied collisional processes during a prolonged microgravity experiment aboard a suborbital flight. Specifically, we describe an impact erosion limit. We observed individual basalt beads, each measuring 0.5\,mm in diameter, colliding with and either eroding or adhering to a cluster several centimetres in size. This cluster, formed from tribocharged particles, simulates an electrostatic growth phase that surpasses the classical bouncing barrier. We found a threshold velocity of about 0.5\,m\,s-1, which separates additive and erosive impacts of individual beads. Numerical simulations of grains impacting clusters, for both low and high charge constituents, corroborate the experimental findings of surface erosion within the observed velocity range. This specific velocity threshold supports the potential formation of pebbles several centimetres in size within protoplanetary disks. Such dimensions place these pebbles well into a regime in which hydrodynamic interactions might facilitate the formation of planetesimals.},

The {$\sim$}10 yr baseline between the event and the Keck observations allows the planetary host star to be detected at a separation of 66.5 {\textpm} 1.7 mas from the source star, consistent with the light-curve model prediction. The combination of the host star brightness and light-curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of Mhost = 0.524 {\textpm} 0.048M{$\odot$} and mp = 67.3 {\textpm} 6.2M{$\oplus$} at a distance of DL = 7.1 {\textpm} 0.7 kpc.

The planet-to-star mass ratio of this system, q = (3.857 {\textpm} 0.029) {\texttimes} 10-4, places it in the predicted "planet desert" at 10-4 {$<$} q {$<$} 4 {\texttimes} 10-4 according to the runaway gas accretion scenario of the core accretion theory. Seven of the 30 planets in the Suzuki et al. sample fall in this mass ratio range, and this is the third with a measured host mass. All three of these host stars have masses of 0.5 {$\leq$} Mhost/M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} 0.7, which implies that this predicted mass ratio gap is filled with planets that have host stars within a factor of two of 1M{$\odot$}. This suggests that runaway gas accretion does not play a major role in determining giant planet masses for stars somewhat less massive than the Sun. Our analysis has been accomplished with a modified DAOPHOT code that has been designed to measure the brightness and positions of closely blended stars. This will aid in the development of the primary method that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope mission will use to determine the masses of microlens planets and their hosts.},

In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice justified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is small. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be significant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal effects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We developed temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich super-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation of state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their radii. For example, for super-Earths with 10~per~cent water by mass, the radius increases by up to 0.5~R{$\oplus$} when the surface temperature is increased from 300 to 1000~K, assuming a surface pressure of 100~bar and an adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing the water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be better than 0.1~R{$\oplus$}. It is therefore important to ensure that the thermal behaviour of water is taken into account when interpreting super-Earth radii using internal structure models.},

  abstract = {We present the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog of transiting exoplanets based on searching 4 yr of Kepler time series photometry (Data Release 25, Q1--Q17). The catalog contains 8054 KOIs, of which 4034 are planet candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 are new, including two in multiplanet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05) and 10 high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter, which automatically vets the DR25 threshold crossing events (TCEs). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discuss the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85\%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98\%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK-dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7\% complete and the catalog is 50.5\% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits, and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

  abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely mysterious: there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence, size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its parent star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a large number ({\textasciitilde}1000) of transiting planets for statistical understanding, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types using transit spectroscopy in the 1.25--7.8~{$\mu$}m spectral range and multiple narrow-band photometry in the optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials compared to their colder Solar System siblings. Said warm and hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the planetary bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets, and in particular of their elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will thus provide a representative picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets and relate this directly to the type and chemical environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of observing a large and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse and phase-curve spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allow us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of 10--100 part per million (ppm) relative to the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give a deeper insight into the nature of the atmosphere. These types of observations require a stable payload and satellite platform with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect many molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds and monitor the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g. H2O, CO2, CH4 NH3, HCN, H2S through to the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and condensed species. Simulations of ARIEL performance in conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed -- using conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model of all significant noise sources in the measurement -- using a list of potential ARIEL targets that incorporates the latest available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion at the end of the Phase A study, is that ARIEL -- in line with the stated mission objectives -- will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets depending on the details of the adopted survey strategy, thus confirming the feasibility of the main science objectives.},

  abstract = {More than three decades have passed since the publication of the last review of the Venus clouds and hazes. The paper published in 1983 in the Venus book summarized the discoveries and findings of the US Pioneer Venus and a series of Soviet Venera spacecraft (Esposito et al. in Venus, p.~484, 1983). Due to the emphasis on in-situ investigations from descent probes, those missions established the basic features of the Venus cloud system, its vertical structure, composition and microphysical properties. Since then, significant progress in understanding of the Venus clouds has been achieved due to exploitation of new observation techniques onboard Galileo and Messenger flyby spacecraft and Venus Express and Akatsuki orbiters. They included detailed investigation of the mesospheric hazes in solar and stellar occultation geometry applied in the broad spectral range from UV to thermal IR. Imaging spectroscopy in the near-IR transparency ``windows'' on the night side opened a new and very effective way of sounding the deep atmosphere. This technique together with near-simultaneous UV imaging enabled comprehensive study of the cloud morphology from the cloud top to its deep layers. Venus Express operated from April 2006 until December 2014 and provided a continuous data set characterizing Venus clouds and hazes over a time span of almost 14 Venus years thus enabling a detailed study of temporal and spatial variability. The polar orbit of Venus Express allowed complete latitudinal coverage. These studies are being complemented by JAXA Akatsuki orbiter that began observations in May 2016. This paper reviews the current status of our knowledge of the Venus cloud system focusing mainly on the results acquired after the Venera, Pioneer Venus and Vega missions.},

This is the largest multiwavelength survey of protostars at this resolution by an order of magnitude. We use the dust continuum emission at 0.87 and 9 mm to measure the dust disk radii and masses toward the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars, characterizing the evolution of these disk properties in the protostellar phase. The mean dust disk radii for the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars are , , and au, respectively, and the mean protostellar dust disk masses are 25.9, , , respectively. The decrease in dust disk masses is expected from disk evolution and accretion, but the decrease in disk radii may point to the initial conditions of star formation not leading to the systematic growth of disk radii or that radial drift is keeping the dust disk sizes small. At least 146 protostellar disks (35\% of 379 detected 0.87 mm continuum sources plus 42 nondetections) have disk radii greater than 50 au in our sample. These properties are not found to vary significantly between different regions within Orion. The protostellar dust disk mass distributions are systematically larger than those of Class II disks by a factor of {$>$}4, providing evidence that the cores of giant planets may need to at least begin their formation during the protostellar phase.},

  abstract = {Prebiotic lake environments containing ferrocyanide could have fostered origins of life chemistry on early Earth. Ferrocyanide can act to concentrate hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a prebiotically important molecule. Additionally, ferrocyanide, coupled with sulfite, can participate in an ultraviolet (UV)-driven photoredox cycle to generate solvated electrons, which can reduce cyanide to form all four major building blocks of life: sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, and lipid precursors. However, longer wavelength UV light ({$\sim$}300--400~nm) causes photoaquation of ferrocyanide into pentacyanoaquaferrate, Fe(CN)5H2O. This species can either regain cyanide to reform ferrocyanide or ultimately lose cyanide ligands, which removes ferrocyanide from solution. Here, we investigate this near ultraviolet (300--400~nm) UV-driven loss of ferrocyanide. In addition to determining the wavelength dependence of the loss and the implications from the UV environment on early Earth, we also study the effects of pH, temperature, and concentration. We find that in dilute, slightly alkaline solutions, ferrocyanide would degrade significantly on the order of minutes under the near UV radiation expected on early Earth. We further determine that the lifetime of ferrocyanide is extended at more alkaline pH, lower temperatures, and higher concentrations. Under a reasonable set of planetary conditions, we find that ferrocyanide lifetimes in irradiated environments range from minutes to hours, or longer. Our results can help to determine the constraints implied by the UV-driven loss of ferrocyanide in prebiotic environments. We assess the potential environmental limits and circumstances that would allow for successful retention of significant amounts of ferrocyanide in prebiotic lakes; we further evaluate how ferrocyanide photoaquation may fit in to the larger network of reactions potentially occurring throughout prebiotic chemistry. For example, our experiments show that CN- can be released from ferrocyanide evaporite salts by aqueous dissolution and UV light, making it potentially available for prebiotic reactions. These results can aid in the construction of consistent and plausible circumstances for prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.},

  abstract = {Objective Training patterns are commonly implicated in running injuries. The purpose of this study was to measure the incidence of injury and illness among marathon runners and the association of injuries with training patterns and workload. Methods Runners registered for the New York City Marathon were eligible to enrol and prospectively monitored during the 16 weeks before the marathon, divided into 4-week `training quarters' (TQ) numbered TQ1--TQ4. Training runs were tracked using Strava, a web and mobile platform for tracking exercise. Runners were surveyed at the end of each TQ on injury and illness, and to verify all training runs were recorded. Acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) was calculated by dividing the running distance in the past 7 days by the running distance in the past 28 days and analysed using ratio thresholds of 1.3 and 1.5. Results A total of 735 runners participated, mean age 41.0 (SD 10.7) and 46.0\% female. Runners tracked 49 195 training runs. The incidence of injury during training was 40.0\% (294/735), and the incidence of injury during or immediately after the marathon was 16.0\% (112/699). The incidence of illness during training was 27.2\% (200/735). Those reporting an initial injury during TQ3 averaged less distance/week during TQ2 compared with uninjured runners, 27.7 vs 31.9 miles/week (p=0.018). Runners reporting an initial injury during TQ1 had more days when the ACWR during TQ1 was {$\geq$}1.5 compared with uninjured runners (injured IQR (0--3) days vs uninjured (0--1) days, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression for training injuries found an association with the number of days when the ACWR was {$\geq$}1.5 (OR 1.06, 95\% CI (1.02 to 1.10), p=0.002). Conclusion Increases in training volume {$\geq$}1.5 ACWR were associated with more injuries among runners training for a marathon. These findings can inform training recommendations and injury prevention programmes for distance runners.},

A second satellite, STARLINK-1113, was observed on 2020/03/06 using a Sloan \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} filter. The initial observation on 2020/02/08 was a test observation conducted when Darksat was still in the process of manoeuvring to its nominal orbit and orientation. Based on the successful test observation, the first main observation took place on 2020/03/06, along with an observation of the second Starlink satellite.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The calibration, image processing, and analysis of the Darksat Sloan \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} image gives an estimated Sloan \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} magnitude of 7.46 {\textpm} 0.04 at a range of 976.50 km. For STARLINK-1113, an estimated Sloan \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} magnitude of 6.59 {\textpm} 0.05 at a range of 941.62 km was found.

The Chakana 0.6 m telescope at the Ckoirama observatory (Chile) observed both satellites on 5 Mar. 2020 (UTC) and 7 Mar. 2020 (UTC) using a Sloan \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} and Sloan \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} filter, respectively. The ESO VISTA 4.1 m telescope with the VIRCAM instrument observed both satellites on 5 Mar. 2020 (UTC) and 7 Mar. 2020 (UTC) in the NIR \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$}-band and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$}-band, respectively.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The calibration, image processing, and analysis of the Darksat images give \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 5.6 mag, \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 5.0 mag, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.2 mag, and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.0 mag when scaled to a range of 550 km (airmass = 1) and corrected for the solar incidence and observer phase angles. In comparison, the STARLINK-1113 images give \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.9 mag, \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.4 mag, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 3.8 mag, and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 3.6 mag when corrected for range, solar incidence, and observer phase angles. The data and results presented in this work show that the special darkening coating used by Starlink for Darksat has darkened the Sloan \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} magnitude by 50\%, Sloan \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} magnitude by 42\%, NIR \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} magnitude by 32\%, and NIR \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} magnitude by 28\%.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The results show that both satellites increase in reflective brightness with increasing wavelength and that the effectiveness of the darkening treatment is reduced at longer wavelengths. This shows that the mitigation strategies being developed by Starlink and other LEO satellite operators need to take into account other wavelengths, not just the optical. This work highlights the continued importance of obtaining multi-wavelength observations of many different LEO satellites in order to characterise their reflective properties and to aid the community in developing impact simulations and developing mitigation tools.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {In the last decade, a dozen close-in giant planets have been discovered orbiting stars with spectral types ranging from M0 to M4, a mystery since known formation pathways do not predict the existence of such systems. Here, we confirm TOI-4860 b, a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting an M4.5 host, a star at the transition between fully and partially convective interiors. First identified with TESS data, we validate the transiting companion's planetary nature through multicolour photometry from the TRAPPIST-South/North, SPECULOOS, and MuSCAT3 facilities. Our analysis yields a radius of \$0.76 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02{\textasciitilde} {\textbackslash}rm R\_\{Jup\}\$ for the planet, a mass of \$0.34{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for the star, and an orbital period of 1.52 d. Using the newly commissioned SPIRIT InGaAs camera at the SPECULOOS-South Observatory, we collect infrared photometry in zYJ that spans the time of secondary eclipse. These observations do not detect a secondary eclipse, placing an upper limit on the brightness of the companion. The planetary nature of the companion is further confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the IRD spectrograph at Subaru Telescope, from which we measure a mass of \$0.67 {\textbackslash}pm 0.14{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Jup\}\$ . Based on its overall density, TOI-4860 b appears to be rich in heavy elements, like its host star.},

We confirm the Jovian mass planets HD33142 b and c with periods of \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}\$ = 330.0\$\_\{-0.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\$ d and \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\$ = 810.2\$\_\{-4.2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.8\}\$ d and minimum dynamical masses of \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}{\textbackslash}sin\{i\}\$ = 1.26\$\_\{-0.05\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ and \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}{\textbackslash}sin\{i\}\$ = 0.89\$\_\{-0.05\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$.

We study the dynamical behavior of the three-planet system configurations with an N-body integration scheme, finding it long-term stable with the planets alternating between low and moderate eccentricities episodes. We also performed N-body simulations, including stellar evolution and second-order dynamical effects such as planet-stellar tides and stellar mass-loss on the way to the white dwarf phase. We find that planets HD33142 b, c and d are likely to be engulfed near the tip of the red giant branch phase due to tidal migration.

The TESS light curves yield significant transit events of two companions, which show strong transit timing variations (TTVs) with a semiamplitude of {$\sim$}6 hr. We performed TTV dynamical and photodynamical light-curve analysis of the TESS data combined with radial velocity measurements from FEROS and PFS, and we confirmed the planetary nature of these companions. The TOI-2525 system consists of a transiting pair of planets comparable to Neptune and Jupiter with estimated dynamical masses of m b = and m c = M Jup, radii of r b = and r c = R Jup, and orbital periods of P b = and P c = days for the inner and outer planet, respectively. The period ratio is close to the 2:1 period commensurability, but the dynamical simulations of the system suggest that it is outside the mean-motion resonance (MMR) dynamical configuration. Object TOI-2525 b is among the lowest-density Neptune-mass planets known to date, with an estimated median density of {$\rho$} b = g cm-3. The TOI-2525 system is very similar to the other K dwarf systems discovered by TESS, TOI-2202 and TOI-216, which are composed of almost identical K dwarf primaries and two warm giant planets near the 2:1 MMR.},

In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarised, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {A planet's history dictates its current potential to host habitable conditions and life. The concept of the continuously habitable zone (CHZ) has been used to define the region around a star most likely to host planets with long-term habitability. However, definitions of the CHZ vary in the literature and often conflict with each other. Calculating the fraction of habitable zone planets in the CHZ as a function of stellar properties, we find that the quality of a star as a host for planets with long-term habitability and biosignatures depends strongly on the formulation of the CHZ used. For instance, older M stars are either excellent or suboptimal hosts for CHZ planets, depending on whether one's definition of habitability prioritizes the total time spent in the habitable zone or the continuity of habitable conditions from the delivery of volatiles to its current age. In this study, we focus on belatedly habitable zone (BHZ) planets, i.e., planets that enter the habitable zone after formation due to the evolution of their host star. We find that between {$\sim$}29\% and 74\% of planets in the habitable zone belong to this class of BHZ planets, depending on the timescale for the delivery of volatiles. Whether these planets can retain their volatiles and support habitable conditions is unclear. Since BHZ planets comprise a large portion of the planets we expect to survey for biosignatures with future missions, the open question of their habitability is an important factor for mission design, survey strategies, and the interpretation of results.},

We demonstrate the utility of the HPIC by using it as an input for yield calculations to predict the science output of various mission designs including those with larger telescope diameters and those focused on other planet types besides Earth analogs, such as Jupiter-mass planets. The breadth and completeness of the HPIC is essential for accurate HWO mission trade studies, and it will be useful for other exoplanet studies and general astrophysics studying the population of bright nearby stars.},

  abstract = {Planets similar to Earth but slightly more irradiated are expected to enter into a runaway greenhouse state, where all surface water rapidly evaporates, forming an optically thick H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O-dominated atmosphere. For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for an increase of only {\textasciitilde}6\% in solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-sized, temperate planets. Using 1D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for thick, hot water vapor-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of percent of the Earth's radius). This abrupt radius inflation resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced transition could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions. These include satellites such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements using ground-based spectrographs such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES, or SPIRou. This radius inflation could also be detected in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1 once masses and radii are known with good enough precision. This result provides the community with an observational test of two points. The first point is the concept of runaway greenhouse, which defines the inner edge of the traditional habitable zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse. Second, it could be used as a test for the presence (and statistical abundance) of water in temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets.}},

  abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1 times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H\textsubscript{2}O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use a 1-D radiative-convective inverse version of the LMD generic numerical climate model to derive new theoretical mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. As a result of the runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect introduced in previous work, these new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -possibly by several orders of magnitude- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08\%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Broadly speaking, our results demonstrate that non-H\textsubscript{2}/He-dominated atmospheres can have a first-order effect on the mass-radius relationships, even for rocky planets receiving moderate irradiation. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H\textsubscript{2}O steam atmosphere thickness as a function of planet core gravity and radius, water content, and irradiation. This formula can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet (i.e., with any kind of interior composition ranging from pure iron to pure silicate) more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.},

  abstract = {Earth has had oceans for nearly four billion years1 and Mars had lakes and rivers 3.5--3.8\,billion years ago2. However, it is still unknown whether water has ever condensed on the surface of Venus3,4 because the planet---now completely dry5---has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history6,7. The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models3 that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds---which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption---have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325\,watts per square metre, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of another stability state for present-day Earth: the `steam Earth', with all the water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Understanding the set of conditions that allow rocky planets to have liquid water on their surface -- in the form of lakes, seas or oceans -- is a major scientific step to determine the fraction of planets potentially suitable for the emergence and development of life as we know it on Earth. This effort is also necessary to define and refine the so-called "Habitable Zone" (HZ) in order to guide the search for exoplanets likely to harbor remotely detectable life forms. Until now, most numerical climate studies on this topic have focused on the conditions necessary to maintain oceans, but not to form them in the first place. Here we use the three-dimensional Generic Planetary Climate Model (PCM), historically known as the LMD Generic Global Climate Model (GCM), to simulate water-dominated planetary atmospheres around different types of Main-Sequence stars. The simulations are designed to reproduce the conditions of early ocean formation on rocky planets due to the condensation of the primordial water reservoir at the end of the magma ocean phase. We show that the incoming stellar radiation (ISR) required to form oceans by condensation is always drastically lower than that required to vaporize oceans. We introduce a Water Condensation Limit, which lies at significantly lower ISR than the inner edge of the HZ calculated with three-dimensional numerical climate simulations. This difference is due to a behavior change of water clouds, from low-altitude dayside convective clouds to high-altitude nightside stratospheric clouds. Finally, we calculated transit spectra, emission spectra and thermal phase curves of TRAPPIST-1b, c and d with H2O-rich atmospheres, and compared them to CO2 atmospheres and bare rock simulations. We show using these observables that JWST has the capability to probe steam atmospheres on low-mass planets, and could possibly test the existence of nightside water clouds.},

  abstract = {Multi-planet systems are valuable arenas for investigating exoplanet architectures and comparing planetary siblings. TOI-1246 is one such system, with a moderately bright K dwarf (\${\textbackslash}rm\{V=11.6,{\textasciitilde}K=9.9\}\$) and four transiting sub-Neptunes identified by TESS with orbital periods of \$4.31{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{d\},{\textasciitilde}5.90{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{d\},{\textasciitilde}18.66{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\$, and \${\textasciitilde}37.92{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\$. We collected 130 radial velocity observations with Keck/HIRES and TNG/HARPS-N to measure planet masses. We refit the 14 sectors of TESS photometry to refine planet radii (\${\textbackslash}rm\{2.97 {\textbackslash}pm 0.06{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\},{\textbackslash}rm\{2.47 {\textbackslash}pm 0.08{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}, {\textbackslash}rm\{3.46 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm\{3.72 {\textbackslash}pm 0.16{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), and confirm the four planets. We find that TOI-1246 e is substantially more massive than the three inner planets (\${\textbackslash}rm\{8.1 {\textbackslash}pm 1.1 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm\{8.8 {\textbackslash}pm 1.2 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm\{5.3 {\textbackslash}pm 1.7 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm\{14.8 {\textbackslash}pm 2.3 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$). The two outer planets, TOI-1246 d and TOI-1246 e, lie near to the 2:1 resonance (\${\textbackslash}rm\{P\_\{e\}/P\_\{d\}=2.03\}\$) and exhibit transit timing variations. TOI-1246 is one of the brightest four-planet systems, making it amenable for continued observations. It is one of only six systems with measured masses and radii for all four transiting planets. The planet densities range from \${\textbackslash}rm\{0.70 {\textbackslash}pm 0.24\}\$ to \$3.21 {\textbackslash}pm 0.44 {\textbackslash}rm\{g/cm{\textasciicircum}3\}\$, implying a range of bulk and atmospheric compositions. We also report a fifth planet candidate found in the RV data with a minimum mass of 25.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 3.6 \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. This planet candidate is exterior to TOI-1246 e with a candidate period of 93.8 d, and we discuss the implications if it is confirmed to be planetary in nature.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet science is booming. In 20 years our knowledge has expanded considerably, from the first discovery of a Hot Jupiter, to the detection of a large population of Neptunes and super-Earths, to the first steps toward the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Between today and 2025, the field will evolve at an even faster pace with the advent of several space-based transit search missions, ground-based spectrographs, high-contrast imaging facilities, and the James Webb Space Telescope. Especially the ESA M-class PLATO mission will be a game changer in the field. From 2024 onwards, PLATO will find transiting terrestrial planets orbiting within the habitable zones of nearby, bright stars. These objects will require the power of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) to be characterized further. The technique of ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy is establishing itself as a crucial pathway to measure chemical composition, atmospheric structure and atmospheric circulation in transiting exoplanets. A high-resolution spectrograph covering the visible and near-IR domains, mounted on the European ELT, will be able to detect molecules such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmospheres of habitable planets under favourable circumstances. E-ELT HiRES is the perfect ground-based match to the PLATO space mission and represents a unique opportunity for Europe to lead the world into the era of exploration of exoplanets with habitable conditions. HiRES will also be extremely complementary to other E-ELT planned instruments specialising in different kinds of planets, such as METIS and EPICS.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Long-period transiting planets provide the opportunity to better understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Their atmospheric properties remain largely unaltered by tidal or radiative effects of the host star, and their orbital arrangement reflects a different and less extreme migrational history compared to close-in objects. The sample of long-period exoplanets with well-determined masses and radii is still limited, but a growing number of long-period objects reveal themselves in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our goal is to vet and confirm single-transit planet candidates detected in the TESS space-based photometric data through spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations with ground-based instruments.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used high-resolution spectrographs to confirm the planetary nature of the transiting candidates and measure their masses. We also used the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to photometrically monitor the candidates in order to observe additional transits. Using a joint modeling of the light curves and radial velocities, we computed the orbital parameters of the system and were able to precisely measure the mass and radius of the transiting planets.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We report the discovery of two massive, warm Jupiter-size planets, one orbiting the F8-type star TOI-5153 and the other orbiting the G1-type star NGTS-20 (=TOI-5152). From our spectroscopic analysis, both stars are metal rich with a metallicity of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Only TOI-5153 presents a second transit in the TESS extended mission data, but NGTS observed NGTS-20 as part of its mono-transit follow-up program and detected two additional transits. Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopic observations were carried out with CORALIE, CHIRON, FEROS, and HARPS. TOI-5153 hosts a planet with a period of 20.33 days, a planetary mass of Jupiter masses (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$}), a radius of \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and an orbital eccentricity of . NGTS-20 b is a \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$} planet with a radius of \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$} on an eccentric orbit with an orbital period of 54.19 days. Both planets are metal enriched and their heavy element content is in line with the previously reported mass-metallicity relation for gas giants.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Both warm Jupiters orbit moderately bright host stars, making these objects valuable targets for follow-up studies of the planetary atmosphere and measurement of the spin-orbit angle of the system.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {A stellar evolution computer model has been used to determine changes in the luminosity L and effective temperature Te of single stars during their time on the main sequence. The range of stellar masses investigated was from 0.5 to 1.5 times that of the Sun, each with a mass fraction of metals (metallicity, Z) from 0.008 to 0.05. The extent of each star's habitable zone (HZ) has been determined from its values of L and Te. These stars form a reference framework for other main sequence stars. All of the 104 main sequence stars known to have one or more giant planets have been matched to their nearest stellar counterpart in the framework, in terms of mass and metallicity, hence closely approximating their HZ limits. The limits of HZ, for each of these stars, have been compared to their giant planet(s)'s range of strong gravitational influence. This allows a quick assessment as to whether Earth-mass planets could exist in stable orbits within the HZ of such systems, both presently and at any time during the star's main sequence lifetime. A determination can also be made as to the possible existence of life-bearing satellites of giant planets, which orbit within HZs. Results show that about half of the 104 known extrasolar planetary systems could possibly have been housing an Earth-mass planet in HZs during at least the past billion years, and about three-quarters of the 104 could do so for at least a billion years at some time during their main sequence lives. Whether such Earth-mass planets could have formed is an urgent question now being investigated by others, with encouraging results.},

  abstract = {The Subaru telescope is currently performing a strategic program (SSP) using the high-precision near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer IRD to search for exoplanets around nearby mid/late-M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs via radial velocity (RV) monitoring. As part of the observing strategy for the exoplanet survey, signatures of massive companions such as RV trends are used to reduce the priority of those stars. However, this RV information remains useful for studying the stellar multiplicity of nearby M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs. To search for companions around such ``deprioritized" M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs, we observed 14 IRD-SSP targets using Keck/NIRC2 observations with pyramid wavefront sensing at NIR wavelengths, leading to high sensitivity to substellar-mass companions within a few arcseconds. We detected two new companions (LSPM{\textasciitilde}J1002+1459{\textasciitilde}B and LSPM{\textasciitilde}J2204+1505{\textasciitilde}B) and two new candidates that are likely companions (LSPM{\textasciitilde}J0825+6902{\textasciitilde}B and LSPM{\textasciitilde}J1645+0444{\textasciitilde}B) as well as one known companion. Including two known companions resolved by the IRD fiber injection module camera, we detected seven (four new) companions at projected separations between \${\textbackslash}sim2-20\${\textasciitilde}au in total. A comparison of the colors with the spectral library suggests that LSPM{\textasciitilde}J2204+1505{\textasciitilde}B and LSPM{\textasciitilde}J0825+6902{\textasciitilde}B are located at the boundary between late-M and early-L spectral types. Our deep high-contrast imaging for targets where no bright companions were resolved did not reveal any additional companion candidates. The NIRC2 detection limits could constrain potential substellar-mass companions (\${\textbackslash}sim10-75{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$) at 10{\textasciitilde}au or further. The failure with Keck/NIRC2 around the IRD-SSP stars having significant RV trends makes these objects promising targets for further RV monitoring or deeper imaging with JWST to search for smaller-mass companions below the NIRC2 detection limits.},

NASA's TESS mission has surveyed young stellar associations across the entire sky for transiting planets providing glimpses into the various stages of planetary evolution. Using our own detection pipeline, we search a magnitude-limited sample of 7219 young stars (\${\textbackslash}leq\$200 Myr) observed in the first four years of TESS for small (2-8 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$), short period (1.6-20 days) transiting planets. The completeness of our survey is characterized by a series of injection and recovery simulations. Our analysis of TESS 2-minute cadence and Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves recover all known TOIs, as well as four new planet candidates not previously identified as TOIs. We derive an occurrence rate of \$35{\textasciicircum}\{+13\}\_\{-10\}\$\% for mini-Neptunes and \$27{\textasciicircum}\{+10\}\_\{-8\}\$\% for super-Neptunes from the 2-minute cadence data, and \$22{\textasciicircum}\{+8.6\}\_\{-6.8\}\$\% for mini-Neptunes and \$13{\textasciicircum}\{+3.9\}\_\{-4.9\}\$\% for super-Neptunes from FFI data. To independently validate our results, we compare our survey yield with the predicted planet yield assuming Kepler planet statistics. We consistently find a mild increase in the occurrence of super-Neptunes and a significant increase in the occurrence of Neptune-sized planets with orbital periods of 6.2-12 days when compared to their mature counterparts. The young planet distribution from our study is most consistent with evolution models describing the early contraction of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres undergoing atmospheric escape and inconsistent with heavier atmosphere models offering only mild radial contraction early on.},

During the past few years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to analyze these data in search of new exoplanets. Different from the existing machine learning works, ExoMiner, the proposed deep learning classifier in this work, mimics how domain experts examine diagnostic tests to vet a transit signal. ExoMiner is a highly accurate, explainable, and robust classifier that (1) allows us to validate 301 new exoplanets from the MAST Kepler Archive and (2) is general enough to be applied across missions such as the ongoing TESS mission. We perform an extensive experimental study to verify that ExoMiner is more reliable and accurate than the existing transit signal classifiers in terms of different classification and ranking metrics. For example, for a fixed precision value of 99\%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6\% of all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall = 0.936), while this rate is 76.3\% for the best existing classifier. Furthermore, the modular design of ExoMiner favors its explainability. We introduce a simple explainability framework that provides experts with feedback on why ExoMiner classifies a transit signal into a specific class label (e.g., planet candidate or not planet candidate).},

LavAtmos is an open-source code that calculates the equilibrium chemical composition of vapor above a melt for a given composition and temperature. Results show that the produced output is in good agreement with the partial pressures obtained from experimental laboratory data as well as with other similar codes from literature. LavAtmos allows for the modeling of vaporisation of a wide range of different mantle compositions of hot-rocky exoplanets. In combination with atmospheric chemistry codes, this enables the characterization of interior compositions through atmospheric signatures.},

Such a valley has been observed recently, owing to an improvement in the precision of stellar and therefore planetary radii. Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small samplewith highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology,which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per cent.We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths ({$\approx$}1.5R{$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\approx$}2.5R{$\oplus$}) separated by a deficiency around 2R{$\oplus$}. We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R{$\alpha$}P{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma$} = -0.09+0.02 -0.04. A negative slope is consistent with models of photoevaporation, but not with the late formation of rocky planets in a gas-poor environment, which would lead to a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to planet cores consisting of a significant fraction of rocky material.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Surveys of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) have provided important information on their demographics, but due to their sample sizes, they cannot be used to study how disk properties vary with the environment. We conduct a survey of the unresolved millimeter continuum emission of 873 protoplanetary disks identified by Spitzer in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud. This is the largest such survey yet, allowing us to identify even weak trends in the median disk mass as a function of position in the cloud and cluster membership. The sample detection rates and median masses are also compared to those of nearby ({$<$}300 pc) SFRs. The sample was observed with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 0.08 mJy/beam (1.5 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$). The data were reduced and imaged using an innovative parallel data processing approach. We detect 58\% (502/873) of the observed disks. This includes 20 disks with dust masses {$>$}100 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, and two objects associated with extended dust emission. We infer a median disk dust mass in the full sample of \$2.2{\textasciicircum}\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. In L1641 and L1647 median dust masses are \$2.1{\textasciicircum}\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ and \$2.6{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.5\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, respectively. The disk mass distribution of the full sample is similar to that of nearby low-mass SFRs at similar ages of 1-3 Myr. We find only weak trends in disk (dust) masses with galactic longitude and between the YSO clusters identified in the sample, with median masses varying by \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 50\%. Age differences may explain these median disk mass variations. Apart from this, disk masses are essentially constant at scales of {\textasciitilde}100 pc. This also suggests that the majority of disks, even in different SFRs, are formed with similar initial masses and evolve at similar rates, assuming no external irradiation, with disk mass loss rates of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$/yr.},

We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies {$>$}1034 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun's flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.},

  abstract = {NASA is engaged in planning for a Habitable Worlds Observatory (HabWorlds), a coronagraphic space mission to detect rocky planets in habitable zones and establish their habitability. Surface liquid water is central to the definition of planetary habitability. Photometric and polarimetric phase curves of starlight reflected by an exoplanet can reveal ocean glint, rainbows and other phenomena caused by scattering by clouds or atmospheric gas. Direct imaging missions are optimised for planets near quadrature, but HabWorlds' coronagraph may obscure the phase angles where such optical features are strongest. The range of accessible phase angles for a given exoplanet will depend on the planet's orbital inclination and/or the coronagraph's inner working angle (IWA). We use a recently-created catalog relevant to HabWorlds of 164 stars to estimate the number of exo-Earths that could be searched for ocean glint, rainbows, and polarization effects due to Rayleigh scattering. We find that the polarimetric Rayleigh scattering peak is accessible in most of the exo-Earth planetary systems. The rainbow due to water clouds at phase angles of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}20-60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ would be accessible with HabWorlds for a planet with an Earth equivalent instellation in \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\{46\}\$ systems, while the ocean glint signature at phase angles of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}130-170{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ would be accessible in \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\{16\}\$ systems, assuming an IWA\$\{=\}62\$ mas (\$3{\textbackslash}lambda/D\$). Improving the IWA\$\{=\}41\$ mas (\$2{\textbackslash}lambda/D\$) increases accessibility to rainbows and glints by factors of approximately 2 and 3, respectively.

  abstract = {Ice-rich planets are formed exterior to the water ice line and thus are expected to contain a substantial amount of ice. The high ice content leads to unique conditions in the interior, under which the structure of a planet is affected by ice interaction with other metals. We apply experimental data of ice--rock interaction at high pressure, and calculate detailed thermal evolution for possible interior configurations of ice-rich planets, in the mass range of super-Earth to Neptunes (5--15 M {$\oplus$}). We model the effect of migration inward on the ice-rich interior by including the influences of stellar flux and envelope mass loss. We find that ice and rock are expected to remain mixed, due to miscibility at high pressure, in substantial parts of the planetary interior for billions of years. We also find that the deep interior of planetary twins that have migrated to different distances from the star are usually similar, if no mass loss occurs. Significant mass loss results in separation of the water from the rock on the surface and emergence of a volatile atmosphere of less than 1\% of the planet's mass. The mass of the atmosphere of water/steam is limited by the ice--rock interaction. We conclude that when ice is abundant in planetary interiors the planet structure may differ significantly from the standard layered structure of a water shell on top of a rocky core. Similar structure is expected in both close-in and further-out planets.},

Here, we utilize previously published instability time-scale prescriptions to determine PLATO's capability to detect a trend of decreasing planet frequency with age for systems with equal- mass planets. For two-planet systems, our results demonstrate that PLATO may detect a trend for planet masses which are at least as massive as super-Earths. For systems with three or more planets, we link their initial compactness to potentially detectable frequency trends in order to aid future investigations when these populations will be better characterized.},

  abstract = {In the search for life beyond our Solar system, attention should be focused on those planets that have the potential to maintain habitable conditions over the prolonged periods of time needed for the emergence and expansion of life as we know it. The observable planetary architecture is one of the determinants for long-term habitability as it controls the orbital evolution and ultimately the stellar fluxes received by the planet. With an ensemble of n-body simulations and obliquity models of hypothetical planetary systems, we demonstrate that the amplitude and period of eccentricity, obliquity, and precession cycles of an Earth-like planet are sensitive to the orbital characteristics of a giant companion planet. A series of transient, ocean-coupled climate simulations show how these characteristics of astronomical cycles are decisive for the evolving surface conditions and long-term fractional habitability relative to the modern Earth. The habitability of Earth-like planets increases with the eccentricity of a Jupiter-like companion, provided that the mean obliquity is sufficiently low to maintain temperate temperatures over large parts of its surface throughout the orbital year. A giant companion closer in results in shorter eccentricity cycles of an Earth-like planet but longer, high-amplitude, obliquity cycles. The period and amplitude of obliquity cycles can be estimated to first order from the orbital pathways calculated by the n-body simulations. In the majority of simulations, obliquity amplitude relates directly to the orbital inclination whereas the period of obliquity cycles is a function of nodal precession and the proximity of a giant companion.},

  abstract = {The Rapid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) experiment is a spatially distributed system of autonomous robotic telescopes that is designed to monitor the sky for optical transients. The core of the ystem is composed of two telescope arrays, separated by 38 kilometers, that stereoscopically view the same 1500 square-degree field with a wide-field imaging array and a central 4 square-degree field with a more sensitive narrow-field ``fovea" imager. Coupled to each telescope array is a real-time data analysis pipeline that is designed to identify interesting transients on timescales of seconds and, when a celestial transient is identified, to command the rapidly slewing robotic mounts to point the narrow-field ``fovea'' imagers at the transient. The two narrow-field telescopes then image the transient with higher spatial resolution and at a faster cadence to gather light curve information. Each ``fovea" camera also images the transient through a different filter to provide color information. This stereoscopic monitoring array is supplemented by a rapidly slewing telescope with a low resolution spectrograph for follow-up observations of transients and a sky patrol telescope that nightly monitors about 10,000 square-degrees for variations, with timescales of a day or longer, to a depth about 100 times fainter. In addition to searching for fast transients, we will use the data stream from RAPTOR as a real-time sentinel for recognizing important variations in known sources. All of the data will be publically released through a virtual observatory called SkyDOT (Sky Database for Objects in the Time Domain) that we are developing for studying variability of the optical sky. Altogether, the RAPTOR project aims to construct a new type of system for discovery in optical astronomy---one that explores the time domain by "mining the sky in real time".},

  abstract = {We have developed an online radiative-transfer suite (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov) applicable to a broad range of planetary objects (e.g., planets, moons, comets, asteroids, TNOs, KBOs, exoplanets). The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.},

Using the sensitive NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we searched for organic compounds and characterized the plume's composition and structure. The observations directly sample the fluorescence emissions of H2O and reveal an extraordinarily extensive plume (up to 10,000 km or 40 Enceladus radii) at cryogenic temperatures (25 K) embedded in a large bath of emission originating from Enceladus' torus. Intriguingly, the observed outgassing rate (300 kg/s) is similar to that derived from close-up observations with Cassini 15 years ago, and the torus density is consistent with previous spatially unresolved measurements with Herschel 13 years ago, suggesting that the vigor of gas eruption from Enceladus has been relatively stable over decadal timescales. This level of activity is sufficient to maintain a derived column density of 4.5x1017 m-2 for the embedding equatorial torus, and establishes Enceladus as the prime source of water across the Saturnian system. We performed searches for several non-water gases (CO2, CO, CH4, C2H6, CH3OH), but none were identified in the spectra. On the surface of the trailing hemisphere, we observe strong H2O ice features, including its crystalline form, yet we do not recover CO2, CO nor NH3 ice signatures from these observations. As we prepare to send new spacecraft into the outer solar system, these observations demonstrate the unique ability of JWST in providing critical support to the exploration of distant icy bodies and cryovolcanic plumes.},

The incidence of transients in the investigated photographic plate is far higher than expected from known detection rates of optical counterparts to e.g. flaring dwarf stars, Fast Radio Bursts, Gamma Ray Bursts or microlensing events. One possible explanation is that the plates have been subjected to an unknown type of contamination producing mainly point sources with of varying intensities along with some mechanism of concentration within a radius of \$\${\textbackslash}sim \$\$10 arcmin on the plate. If contamination as an explanation can be fully excluded, another possibility is fast (t \$\${$<$}0.5\$\$s) solar reflections from objects near geosynchronous orbits.

Using transit timing measurements from Kepler, Palomar/WIRC, and TESS, we show that the orbital period of Kepler-1658b appears to be decreasing at a rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{P\}=\{131\}\_\{-22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+20\}\$ ms yr-1, corresponding to an infall timescale \$P/{\textbackslash}dot\{P\}{\textbackslash}approx 2.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ .

We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: (1) the relative mass function and (2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions and the detection limits on lower mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that (1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of N {$\propto$} M-1.3{\textpm}0.03, and consequently, (2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected substellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.},

Giant planets are expected to form either by core accretion, which is typically associated with low initial entropy (cold-start models) or by gravitational instability, associated with high initial entropy of the gas (hot-start models). Thus, constraining the initial entropy can provide insight into a planet's formation process and determines the resultant brightness evolution. In this study, we find that, by observing planets in nearby moving groups of known age both through direct imaging and astrometry with Gaia, it will be possible to constrain the initial entropy of giant planets. We simulate a set of planetary systems in stars in nearby moving groups identified by BANYAN {$\Sigma$} and assume a model for planet distribution consistent with radial-velocity detections. We find that Gaia should be able to detect approximately 25~per\,cent of planets in nearby moving groups greater than \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}text\{J\}\$. Using 5{$\sigma$} contrast limits of current and future instruments, we calculate the flux uncertainty, and using models for the evolution of the planet brightness, we convert this to an initial entropy uncertainty. We find that future instruments such as METIS on E-ELT as well as GRAVITY and VIKiNG with VLTI should be able to constrain the entropy to within 0.5\,kB/baryon, which implies that these instruments should be able to distinguish between hot- and cold-start models.},

High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes, HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone around an M-dwarf star at 10-4 star light suppression level. Compared to the 10-7 planet/star contrast, HDC relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of 103. For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 104. Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R = 400 (1600) is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with planet/star contrast = is relaxed by a factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).},

  abstract = {A simple, idealized model for the rapid escape of a hydrogen thermosphere provides some quantitative estimates for the energy-limited flux of escaping particles. The model assumes that the atmosphere is ``tightly bound'' by the gravitational field at lower altitudes, that diffusion through the lower atmosphere does not limit the flux, and that the main source of heating is solar euv. Rather low thermospheric temperatures are typical of such escape and a characteristic minimum develops in the temperature profile as the escape flux approaches its maximum possible value. The flux is limited by the amount of euv energy absorbed, which is in turn controlled by the radial extent of the thermosphere. Regardless of the amount of hydrogen in the thermosphere, the low temperatures accompanying rapid escape limit its extent, and thus constrain the flux. Applied to the Earth and Venus, the results suggest that the escape of hydrogen from these planets would have been energy-limited if their primordial atmospheres contained total hydrogen mixing ratios exceeding a few percent. Hydrogen and deuterium may have been lost in bulk, but heavier elements would have remained in the atmosphere. These results place constraints on hypotheses for the origin of the planets and their subsequent evolution.},

At its current rotation period, Venus's climate could have remained habitable until at least 0.715 Gya.

Part of the basis for this optimistic scenario is the high deuterium to hydrogen ratio from the Pioneer Venus mission that was interpreted to imply Venus had a shallow ocean's worth of water throughout much of its history. Another view is that Venus had a long-lived ({$\sim$}100 million years) primordial magma ocean with a CO2 and steam atmosphere. Venus' long-lived steam atmosphere would sufficient time to dissociate most of the water vapor, allow significant hydrogen escape, and oxidize the magma ocean. A third scenario is that Venus had surface water and habitable conditions early in its history for a short period of time ({$<$}1 Gyr), but that a moist/runaway greenhouse took effect because of a gradually warming Sun, leaving the planet desiccated ever since. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate the viability of the first scenario using the few observational constraints available. We further speculate that large igneous provinces and the global resurfacing hundreds of millions of years ago played key roles in ending the clement period in its history and presenting the Venus we see today. The results have implications for what astronomers term ``the habitable zone,'' and if Venus-like exoplanets exist with clement conditions akin to modern Earth, we propose to place them in what we term the ``optimistic Venus zone.''},

  abstract = {Context. Current research has established magnetised disc winds as a promising way of driving accretion in protoplanetary discs. Aims. We investigate the evolution of large protoplanetary disc populations under the influence of magnetically driven disc winds as well as internal and external photoevaporation. We aim to constrain magnetic disc wind models through comparisons with observations. Methods. We ran 1D vertically integrated evolutionary simulations for low-viscosity discs, including magnetic braking and various outflows. The initial conditions were varied and chosen to produce populations that are representative of actual disc populations inferred from observations. We then compared the observables from the simulations (e.g. stellar accretion rate, disc mass evolution, disc lifetime, etc.) with observational data. Results. Our simulations show that to reach stellar accretion rates comparable to those found by observations \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot / {\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\$, it is necessary to have access not only to strong magnetic torques, but weak magnetic winds as well. The presence of a strong magnetic disc wind, in combination with internal photoevaporation, leads to the rapid opening of an inner cavity early on, allowing the stellar accretion rate to drop while the disc is still massive. Furthermore, our model supports the notion that external photoevaporation via the ambient far-ultraviolet radiation of surrounding stars is a driving force in disc evolution and could potentially exert a strong influence on planetary formation. Conclusions. Our disc population syntheses show that for a subset of magnetohydrodynamic wind models (weak disc wind, strong torque), it is possible to reproduce important statistical observational constraints. The magnetic disc wind paradigm thus represents a novel and appealing alternative to the classical \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-viscosity scenario.},

We compared the stellar and planetary properties of the multis and singles in a homogenous subset of the full CKS-Gaia catalog. We found that sub-Neptune sized singles and multis do not differ in their stellar properties or planet radii. In particular: (1.) The distributions of stellar properties \$M\_{\textbackslash}backslashstar\$, [Fe/H], and \$v{\textbackslash}backslashmathrm\{sin\}i\$ for the Kepler sub Neptune-sized singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the sub-Neptune sized singles and multis with \$P {\textbackslash}textgreater 3\$ days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley at \${\textbackslash}backslashsim1.8{$\sim$}R\_{\textbackslash}backslashoplus\$. However, there are significantly more detected short-period (\$P {\textbackslash}textless 3\$ days), sub-Neptune sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host star properties, planet radii, and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations. One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.},

  abstract = {One of the most important developments in exoplanet science in the past decade is the discovery of multi-planet systems with sub-Neptune-sized planets interior to 1{\textasciitilde}AU. This chapter explores the architectures of these planetary systems, which often display a remarkable degree of uniformity: the planets have nearly equal sizes, regular orbital spacing, low eccentricities, and small mutual inclinations. This uniformity stands in sharp contrast to the diverse nature of the exoplanet sample considered as a whole (as well as our inner solar system). We begin with a critical review of the observations -- including possible biases -- and find that these peas-in-a-pod planetary systems are apparently a common outcome of the planet formation process. Modest departures from exact uniformity suggest additional patterns, such as the planet mass slowly increasing with semi-major axis. The star formation process naturally produces circumstellar disks with the properties required to produce these planetary systems, although the solid material must move inward from its initial location. We discuss primary modes of planetary assembly, the role of orbital migration, and post-nebular atmospheric loss. Mature planetary systems are found to be near their minimum energy (tidal equilibrium) configurations; this finding provides a partial explanation for their observed properties and indicates that efficient energy dissipation must occur. Finally, we consider population synthesis models and show that peas-in-a-pod patterns emerge with reasonable choices for the input parameters. Nonetheless, interesting observational and theoretical challenges remain in order to understand how these surprisingly organized planetary systems arise from the disorder of their formation processes.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Large sub-Neptunes are uncommon around the coolest stars in the Galaxy and are rarer still around those that are metal-poor. However, owing to the large planet-to-star radius ratio, these planets are highly suitable for atmospheric study via transmission spectroscopy in the infrared, such as with JWST.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we report the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune orbiting the thick-disk, mid-M dwarf star TOI-2406. The star's low metallicity and the relatively large size and short period of the planet make TOI-2406 b an unusual outcome of planet formation, and its characterisation provides an important observational constraint for formation models.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We first infer properties of the host star by analysing the star's near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} parallax. We use multi-band photometry to confirm that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and we statistically validate the TESS signal as a transiting exoplanet. We then determine physical properties of the planet through global transit modelling of the TESS and ground-based time-series data.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We determine the host to be a metal-poor M4 V star, located at a distance of 56 pc, with properties \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3100 {\textpm} 75 K, \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.162 {\textpm} 0.008\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.202 {\textpm} 0.011\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, and [Fe/H] = -0.38 {\textpm} 0.07, and a member of the thick disk. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the M-dwarf planet population, with \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{p{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} = 2.94 {\textpm} 0.17\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{P{$<$}i/{$>$}= 3.077 d, producing transits of 2\% depth. We note the orbit has a non-zero eccentricity to 3\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}, prompting questions about the dynamical history of the system.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} This system is an interesting outcome of planet formation and presents a benchmark for large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass stars. The system warrants further study, in particular radial velocity follow-up to determine the planet mass and constrain possible bound companions. Furthermore, TOI-2406 b is a good target for future atmospheric study through transmission spectroscopy. Although the planet's mass remains to be constrained, we estimate the S/N using amass-radius relationship, ranking the system fifth in the population of large sub-Neptunes, with TOI-2406 b having a much lower equilibrium temperature than other spectroscopically accessible members of this population.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Analysis of this unprecedentedly large sample confirms the previously detected decrease in the fraction of magnetically active stars (as traced by H{$\alpha$} emission) as a function of the vertical distance from the Galactic plane. The magnitude and slope of this effect vary as a function of spectral type. Using simple 1D dynamical models, we demonstrate that the drop in activity fraction can be explained by thin-disk dynamical heating and a rapid decrease in magnetic activity. The timescale for this rapid activity decrease changes according to the spectral type. By comparing our data to the simulations, we calibrate the age--activity relation at each M dwarf spectral type. We also present evidence for a possible decrease in the metallicity as a function of height above the Galactic plane. In addition to our activity analysis, we provide line measurements, molecular band indices, colors, radial velocities, 3D space motions, and mean properties as a function of spectral type for the SDSS DR5 low-mass star sample.},

These factors place constraints on the types of Hadean environment in which life could have emerged. Many locations, ranging from hydrothermal vents and pumice rafts, through volcanic-hosted splash pools to continental springs and rivers, have been proposed for the emergence of life on Earth, each with respective advantages and certain disadvantages. However, there is another, hitherto unrecognized environment that, on the Hadean Earth (4.5--4.0\,Ga), would have been more important than any other in terms of spatial and temporal scale: the sedimentary layer between oceanic crust and seawater. Using as an example sediments from the 3.5--3.33\,Ga Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa, analogous at least on a local scale to those of the Hadean eon, we document constant permeation of the porous, carbonaceous, and reactive sedimentary layer by hydrothermal fluids emanating from the crust. This partially UV-protected, subaqueous sedimentary environment, characterized by physical and chemical gradients, represented a widespread system of miniature chemical reactors in which the production and complexification of prebiotic molecules could have led to the origin of life.

Prebiotic equivalents such as methyl thioacetate and acetyl phosphate have been proposed to catalyse analogous reactions at the origin of life, but their propensity to hydrolyse challenges this view. Here we show that acetyl phosphate (AcP) can be synthesised in water within minutes from thioacetate (but not methyl thioacetate) under ambient conditions. AcP is stable over hours, depending on temperature, pH and cation content, giving it an ideal poise between stability and reactivity. We show that AcP can phosphorylate nucleotide precursors such as ribose to ribose-5-phosphate and adenosine to adenosine monophosphate, at modest ({\textasciitilde}2\%) yield in water, and at a range of pH. AcP can also phosphorylate ADP to ATP in water over several hours at 50~{$^\circ$}C. But AcP did not promote polymerization of either glycine or AMP. The amino group of glycine was preferentially acetylated by AcP, especially at alkaline pH, hindering the formation of polypeptides. AMP formed small stacks of up to 7 monomers, but these did not polymerise in the presence of AcP in aqueous solution. We conclude that AcP can phosphorylate biologically meaningful substrates in a manner analogous to ATP, promoting the origins of metabolism, but is unlikely to have driven polymerization of macromolecules such as polypeptides or RNA in free solution. This is consistent with the idea that a period of monomer (cofactor) catalysis preceded the emergence of polymeric enzymes or ribozymes at the origin of life.},

We show that planets partially covered by water will appear measurably brighter near crescent phase (relative to Lambertian planets) because of the efficient specular reflection ("glint") of starlight incident on their surfaces at a highly oblique angle. Planets on orbits within 30{$^\circ$} of edge-on orientation (50\% of all planets) will show pronounced glint over a sizeable range of orbital longitudes, from quadrature to crescent, all outside the glare of their parent stars. Also, water-covered planets will appear darker than a Lambertian disk near full illumination.

To further understand this connection, we make the first ever measurement of the correlation between planet occurrence and chemical abundances for ten different elements (C, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Ni). Leveraging data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia to derive precise stellar parameters (, ) for a sample of 1018 Kepler Objects of Interest, we construct a sample of well-vetted Kepler planets with precisely measured radii (). After controlling for biases in the Kepler detection pipeline and the selection function of the APOGEE survey, we characterize the relationship between planet occurrence and chemical abundance as the number density of nuclei of each element in a star's photosphere raised to a power, {$\beta$}. varies by planet type, but is consistent within our uncertainties across all ten elements. For hot planets (P = 1--10 days), an enhancement in any element of 0.1 dex corresponds to an increased occurrence of {$\approx$}20\% for super-Earths (R p = 1--1.9 R {$\oplus$}) and {$\approx$}60\% for sub-Neptunes (R p = 1.9--4 R {$\oplus$}). Trends are weaker for warm (P = 10--100 days) planets of all sizes and for all elements, with the potential exception of sub-Saturns (R p = 4--8 R {$\oplus$}). Finally, we conclude this work with a caution to interpreting trends between planet occurrence and stellar age due to degeneracies caused by Galactic chemical evolution and make predictions for planet occurrence rates in nearby open clusters to facilitate demographics studies of young planetary systems.},

However, recent three-dimensional global climate modeling efforts have revealed that rocky planet habitability is strongly impacted by radiative cloud feedbacks, where computational expense and model limitations can prevent these tools from exploring the limits of habitability across the full range of parameter space. We leverage a patchy cloud one-dimensional radiative-convective climate model with parameterized cloud microphysics to investigate Inner Edge limits to the Habitable Zone for main sequence stars (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ = 2600 -7200K). We find that Inner Edge limits to the Habitable Zone can be 3.3 and 4.7 times closer than previous cloud-free estimates for Earth- and super-Earth-sized worlds, respectively, depending on bulk cloud parameters (e.g., fractional cloudiness and sedimentation efficiency). These warm, moist Inner Edge climates are expected to have extensive cloud decks that could mute deep atmosphere spectral features. To aid in rocky planet characterization studies, we identify the potential of using \${\textbackslash}rm\{CO\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\}\}\$ absorption features in transmission spectroscopy as a means of quantifying cloud deck height and cloud sedimentation efficiency. Moist greenhouse climates may represent key yet poorly understood states of habitable planets for which continued study will uncover new insights into the search and characterization of habitable worlds.},

  abstract = {The origin of life on Earth would benefit from a prebiotic atmosphere that produced nitriles, like HCN, which enable ribonucleotide synthesis. However, geochemical evidence suggests that Hadean air was relatively oxidizing with negligible photochemical production of prebiotic molecules. These paradoxes are resolved by iron-rich asteroid impacts that transiently reduced the entire atmosphere, allowing nitriles to form in subsequent photochemistry. Here, we investigate impact-generated reducing atmospheres using new time-dependent, coupled atmospheric chemistry and climate models, which account for gas-phase reactions and surface-catalysis. The resulting H\$\_2\$-, CH\$\_4\$- and NH\$\_3\$-rich atmospheres persist for millions of years, until hydrogen escapes to space. HCN and HCCCN production and rainout to the surface can reach \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ molecules cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in hazy atmospheres with a mole ratio of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\_4\} / {\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\_2\} {$>$} 0.1\$. Smaller \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\_4\} / {\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\_2\}\$ ratios produce HCN rainout rates \${$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ molecules cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and negligible HCCCN. The minimum impactor mass that creates atmospheric \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\_4\} / {\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\_2\} {$>$} 0.1\$ is \$4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{20\}\$ to \$5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{21\}\$ kg (570 to 1330 km diameter), depending on how efficiently iron reacts with a steam atmosphere, the extent of atmospheric equilibration with an impact-induced melt pond, and the surface area of nickel that catalyzes CH\$\_4\$ production. Alternatively, if steam permeates and deeply oxidizes crust, impactors \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{20\}\$ kg could be effective. Atmospheres with copious nitriles have \${$>$} 360\$ K surface temperatures, perhaps posing a challenge for RNA longevity, although cloud albedo can produce cooler climates. Regardless, post-impact cyanide can be stockpiled and used in prebiotic schemes after hydrogen has escaped to space.},

The discovery paper argued the data are best explained by a habitable "Hycean" world, consisting of a relatively thin H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere overlying a liquid water ocean. Here, we use photochemical and climate models to simulate K2-18b as both a Hycean planet and a gas-rich mini-Neptune with no defined surface. We find that a lifeless Hycean world is hard to reconcile with the JWST observations because photochemistry only supports \${$<$} 1\$ part-per-million CH\$\_4\$ in such an atmosphere while the data suggest about \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the gas is present. Sustaining \%-level CH\$\_4\$ on a Hycean K2-18b may require the presence of a methane-producing biosphere, similar to microbial life on Earth \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ billion years ago. On the other hand, we predict that a gas-rich mini-Neptune with \$100 {\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity should have 4\% CH\$\_4\$ and nearly 0.1\% CO\$\_2\$, which are compatible with the JWST data. The CH\$\_4\$ and CO\$\_2\$ are produced thermochemically in the deep atmosphere and mixed upward to the low pressures sensitive to transmission spectroscopy. The model predicts H\$\_2\$O, NH\$\_3\$ and CO abundances broadly consistent with the non-detections. Given the additional obstacles to maintaining a stable temperate climate on Hycean worlds due to H\$\_2\$ escape and potential supercriticality at depth, we favor the mini-Neptune interpretation because of its relative simplicity and because it does not need a biosphere or other unknown source of methane to explain the data.},

  abstract = {On water-dominated planets, warming from increased solar insolation is strongly amplified by the water vapor greenhouse feedback. As the Sun brightens due to stellar evolution, Earth will become uninhabitable due to rising temperatures. Here we use a modified version of the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study Earth under intense solar radiation. For small ({$\leq$}10\%) increases in the solar constant (S0), Earth warms nearly linearly with climate sensitivities of 1 K/(W m-2) and global mean surface temperatures below 310 K. However, an abrupt shift in climate is found as the solar constant is increased to +12.5\% S0. Here climate sensitivity peaks at 6.5 K/(W m-2), while global mean surface temperatures rise above 330 K. This climatic transition is associated with a fundamental change to the radiative-convective state of the atmosphere. Hot, moist climates feature both strong solar absorption and inefficient radiative cooling in the low atmosphere, thus yielding net radiative heating of the near-surface layers. This heating forms an inversion that effectively shuts off convection in the boundary layer. Beyond the transition, Earth continues to warm but with climate sensitivities again near unity. Conditions conducive to significant water loss to space are not found until +19\% S0. Earth remains stable against a thermal runaway up to at least +21\% S0, but at that point, global mean surface temperatures exceed 360 K, and water loss to space becomes rapid. Water loss of the oceans from a moist greenhouse may preclude a thermal runaway.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii {$<$}4 , paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in this Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass--radius relationship (M--R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M--R relation parameters. We analyze how the results depend on the radius range of the sample, and on how the masses were measured. Assuming that the M--R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that , a scatter in mass of , and a mass constraint to physically plausible densities, is the ``best-fit'' probabilistic M--R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (Rpl {$<$} 4 ). More broadly, this work provides a framework for further analyses of the M--R relation and its probable dependencies on period and stellar properties.},

  abstract = {Water photolysis and hydrogen loss from the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets is of fundamental importance to climate evolution but remains poorly understood in general. Here we present a range of calculations we performed to study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss only occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1--1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but X-ray and ultraviolet/ultravoilet luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like Earth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets that absorb less flux than {$\sim$}270 W m-2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than one Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their atmospheric N2/CO2 early on. Because of the variability of H2O delivery during accretion, our results suggest that many ``Earth-like'' exoplanets in the habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO2/H2O-rich atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.},

Hence the spectral features of O2 and O3 alone cannot be regarded as robust signs of extraterrestrial life.},

Here we take a generalized approach to this phenomenon. Using a single parameter to describe the redox state, we model the evolution of terrestrial planets around nearby M stars and the Sun. Our model includes atmospheric photochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations, and interior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases, we find abiotic atmospheric buildup around M stars during the pre-main-sequence phase to be much less than calculated previously, because the planet's magma ocean absorbs most oxygen liberated from photolysis. However, loss of noncondensing atmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant potential route to abiotic atmospheric subsequently. In all cases, we predict that exoplanets that receive lower stellar fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST-1f and g, have the lowest probability of abiotic buildup and hence may be the most interesting targets for future searches for biogenic . Key remaining uncertainties can be minimized in future by comparing our predictions for the atmospheres of hot, sterile exoplanets such as GJ1132b and TRAPPIST-1b and c with observations.},

Several ideas for making the Martian surface more habitable have been put forward5--8, but they all involve massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability for the foreseeable future9. Here, we present a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under Martian environmental conditions, a 2--3\,cm-thick layer of silica aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation and raise temperatures underneath it permanently to above the melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically, starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme environments on Earth today.},

Thanks to a wealth of recent planet discoveries and upcoming advances in observing capability, we are poised to characterize the atmospheres of dozens of rocky exoplanets in this decade. The theoretical understanding of rocky exoplanet atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last few years, yielding testable predictions of their evolution, chemistry, dynamics, and even possible biosignatures. We review key progress in this field to date and discuss future objectives. Our major conclusions are as follows: ▪ Many rocky planets may form with initial H2--He envelopes that are later lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and internal heating. ▪ After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric compositions is expected as a result of variations in host star flux, atmospheric escape rates, interior exchange, and other factors. ▪ Observations have ruled out both the presence of H2-dominated atmospheres on several nearby rocky exoplanets and the presence of any thick atmosphere on one target. A more detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and others will become possible in the near future. ▪ Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However, reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further advances in observing capability and improvements in our understanding of abiotic planetary processes.},

  abstract = {Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) can be induced by a range of physical phenomena, including planet-planet interactions, planet-moon interactions, and stellar activity. Recent work has shown that roughly half of moons would induce fast TTVs with a short period in the range of two-to-four orbits of its host planet around the star. An investigation of the Kepler TTV data in this period range identified one primary target of interest, Kepler-1513 b. Kepler-1513 b is a \$8.05{\textasciicircum}\{+0.58\}\_\{-0.40\}\$ \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ planet orbiting a late G-type dwarf at \$0.53{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}\$ AU. Using Kepler photometry, this initial analysis showed that Kepler-1513 b's TTVs were consistent with a moon. Here, we report photometric observations of two additional transits nearly a decade after the last Kepler transit using both ground-based observations and space-based photometry with TESS. These new transit observations introduce a previously undetected long period TTV, in addition to the original short period TTV signal. Using the complete transit dataset, we investigate whether a non-transiting planet, a moon, or stellar activity could induce the observed TTVs. We find that only a non-transiting perturbing planet can reproduce the observed TTVs. We additionally perform transit origami on the Kepler photometry, which independently applies pressure against a moon hypothesis. Specifically, we find that Kepler-1513 b's TTVs are consistent with an exterior non-transiting \${\textbackslash}sim\$Saturn mass planet, Kepler-1513 c, on a wide orbit, \${\textbackslash}sim\$5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ outside a 5:1 period ratio with Kepler-1513 b.

  abstract = {The planets of the solar system are neatly divided between those with atmospheres and those without when arranged by insolation (I) and escape velocity (). The dividing line goes at . Exoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the extrapolation of the solar system trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline that unites all the planets. The relation may implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly irradiated extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences () using proxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as , which differs distinctly from the apparent relation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the highly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can lose more than 1\% of its mass as H2. Impact erosion, to the extent that impact velocities can be estimated for exoplanets, fits a shoreline. The proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet Shoemaker--Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the metaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic accretion, high impact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of the runaway greenhouse, and Proxima Centauri's XUV radiation. In its favor is a vast phase space of unknown unknowns.},

  abstract = {Earth is the type example of a habitable planet. This chapter begins in the cloud of gas and dust that gave birth to the solar system, and ends on Earth before the dawn of life. Solid grains condensed or evaporated in the solar nebula according to temperature. How grains were gathered into planetesimals is not yet known; the leading hypothesis is that gravito-aerodynamic mechanisms concentrated grains into denser clumps that collapsed directly into full-grown planetesimals. Radioactive 7{$^\circ$}Al melted the first generation of planetesimals. Isotopic trends in several elements show that solid materials in the solar nebula were early separated into an inner solar system reservoir, denoted "NC," and an outer solar system reservoir, denoted "CC," divided by the creation of the giant planets. Earth and Moon are genetically related to enstatite chondrites (ECs), and not to NC materials in general, nor to the outer solar system CC materials. Earth and the ECs appear to sample complementary reservoirs descended from a common ancestor. A collision between two planets formed the Moon and Earth some 50-150 m.y. after the Sun formed. An excess of lightly fractionated highly siderophile elements in Earth's mantle implies that Earth accreted about 0.5\% of its mass as a "late veneer" after the Moon- forming impact. Isotopes group the late veneer with dry EC-like inner solar system material, hence Earth's water apparently predates the late veneer. The origin of life on Earth implies a reduced early atmosphere, rich in CH4, and H2, but geological evidence suggests that Earth's mantle has always been relatively oxidized and volcanic gases dominated by CO2, and H2O. Transient CH4,-rich, H2-rich atmospheres created by iron-rich EC-like impacts big enough to vaporize the oceans can resolve the paradox. The near absence of solar neon on Earth suggests that Earth's building blocks either did not attract significant nebular atmospheres, or that any nebular atmospheres were lost after the nebula dispersed. The heavier noble gases provide other evidence constraining histories of atmospheric escape. A complete picture of Earth requires a better understanding of Venus, because Venus contains nearly half the mass of the inner solar system, and therefore holds secret the other half of the story.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that the "Kepler dichotomy" -- the apparent excess of planetary systems with a single detected transiting planet in the Kepler catalog -- reflects an intrinsic bimodality in the mutual inclinations of planetary orbits. After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation of planetary semimajor axes into distinct "clusters". We find that our simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a migration trap -- a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant co-rotation torque prevents inward migration -- which splits the system into two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass systems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer planets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture by co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the structure of protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {Context. Teegarden's Star is the brightest and one of the nearest ultra-cool dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. For its late spectral type (M7.0 V), the star shows relatively little activity and is a prime target for near-infrared radial velocity surveys such as CARMENES. Aims. As part of the CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs, we obtained more than 200 radial-velocity measurements of Teegarden's Star and analysed them for planetary signals. Methods. We find periodic variability in the radial velocities of Teegarden's Star. We also studied photometric measurements to rule out stellar brightness variations mimicking planetary signals. Results. We find evidence for two planet candidates, each with 1.1 M {$\oplus$} minimum mass, orbiting at periods of 4.91 and 11.4 d, respectively. No evidence for planetary transits could be found in archival and follow-up photometry. Small photometric variability is suggestive of slow rotation and old age. Conclusions. The two planets are among the lowest-mass planets discovered so far, and they are the first Earth-mass planets around an ultra-cool dwarf for which the masses have been determined using radial velocities.},

Such theoretical models rely on our understanding of the Earth's interior, as well as independently derived equations of state, but so far have not involved direct extrapolations from Earth's seismic model: the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). To facilitate more detailed compositional comparisons between small exoplanets and the Earth, we derive here a semi-empirical mass--radius relation for two-layer rocky planets based on PREM, , where CMF stands for core mass fraction. It is applicable to 1 {$\sim$} 8 M{$\oplus$} and a CMF of 0.0 {$\sim$} 0.4.

The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2--He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10--15 M, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2-to 4-R range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are ``water worlds''.},

Herein we report the discovery of 10 rapidly rotating M dwarfs with highly structured rotational modulation patterns among 371 M dwarfs found to have rotation periods less than 1 day. Starspot models cannot explain the highly structured periodic variations that typically exhibit between 10 and 40 Fourier harmonics. A similar set of objects was previously reported following K2 observations of the Upper Scorpius association. We examine the possibility that the unusual structured light curves could stem from absorption by charged dust particles that are trapped in or near the stellar magnetosphere. We also briefly explore the possibilities that the sharp structured features in the light curves are produced by extinction by coronal gas, by beaming of the radiation emitted from the stellar surface, or by occultations of spots by a dusty ring that surrounds the star. The last is perhaps the most promising of these scenarios. Most of the structured rotators display flaring activity, and we investigate changes in the modulation pattern following the largest flares. As part of this study, we also report the discovery of 17 rapidly rotating M dwarfs with rotational periods below 4 hr, of which the shortest period is 1.63 hr.},

  abstract = {We propose a general principle that under radiative-convective equilibrium, the spatial and temporal variations in a planet's surface and atmosphere tend to increase its cooling. This principle is based on Jensen's inequality and the curvature of the response functions of surface temperature and outgoing cooling flux to changes in incoming stellar flux and atmospheric opacity. We use an analytical model to demonstrate that this principle holds for various planet types: (1) on an airless planet, the mean surface temperature is lower than its equilibrium temperature; (2) on terrestrial planets with atmospheres, the inhomogeneity of incoming stellar flux and atmospheric opacity reduces the mean surface temperature; (3) on giant planets, inhomogeneously distributed stellar flux and atmospheric opacity increase the outgoing infrared flux, cooling the interior. Although the inhomogeneity of visible opacity might sometimes heat the atmosphere, the effect is generally much smaller than the inhomogeneous cooling effect of infrared opacity. Compared with the homogeneous case, the mean surface temperature on inhomogeneous terrestrial planets can decrease by more than 20\%, and the internal heat flux on giant planets can increase by over an order of magnitude. Despite simplifications in our analytical framework, the effect of stellar flux inhomogeneity appears to be robust, while further research is needed to fully understand the effects of opacity inhomogeneity in more realistic situations. This principle impacts our understanding of planetary habitability and the evolution of giant planets using low-resolution and one-dimensional frameworks that may have previously overlooked the role of inhomogeneity.},

  abstract = {The advent of the laser-frequency comb as the wavelength calibration unit allows us to measure the radial velocity (RV) at cm\,s-1 precision level with high stability in the long term, which enables the possibility of the detection of Earth twins around solar-like stars. A recent study shows that the laser-frequency comb can also be used to measure and study the precision of the instrumental system including the variations of line profile and the systematic uncertainty and instrumental drift. In this paper, we present the stringent analysis of a laser-frequency comb (LFC) system with 25\,GHz repetition frequency on an R {$\sim$} 50\,000 spectrograph with the wavelength spanning from 5085--7380 {\AA}. We report a novel fitting model optimized for the comb line profile, the constrained double Gaussian. The constraint condition is set as \${\textbackslash}left{\textbar}{\textbackslash}mu \_\{1,2\} - {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}right{\textbar} {\textbackslash}lt {\textbackslash}sqrt\{2{\textbackslash}ln2\}{\textbackslash}sigma\$. We introduce a Bayesian information criterion to test various models. Compared to the traditional Gaussian model, the CDG (constrained double Gaussian) model provides a much better goodness of fit. We apply the CDG model to the observed comb data to demonstrate the improvement of the RV precision with the CDG model. We find that the improvement of the CDG model is about 40--60~per\,cent for wavelength calibration precision. We also consider the use of the LFC and CDG model as a tool to characterize the line-shape variation across the detector. The aim of this work is to measure and understand the details of the comb lines including their asymmetry and behaviours under various conditions, which play a significant role in the simultaneous calibration process and cross-correlation function method to determine the Doppler shift at high precision level.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly (\${\textbackslash}backslashsim90{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$) companied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H]\${\textbackslash}textgreater0.1\$) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to \$60{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare (\${\textbackslash}backslashsim1{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition.

In contrary to some earlier findings, a recent study conducted by Bonomo et al.{\textbackslash} suggests that the occurrence of cold Jupiter companions is not excessive in super Earth systems. Here we show that this discrepancy can be seen as a Simpson's paradox and is resolved once the metallicity dependence of the super Earth--cold Jupiter relation is taken into account. A common feature is noticed that almost all the cold Jupiter detections with inner super Earth companions are found around metal-rich stars. Focusing on the Sun-like hosts with super-solar metallicities, we show that the frequency of cold Jupiters conditioned on the presence of inner super Earths is \$39\_\{-11\}{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}{\textbackslash}\%\$, whereas the frequency of cold Jupiters in the same metallicity range is no more than \$20{\textbackslash}\%\$. Therefore, the occurrences of close-in super Earths and distant cold Jupiters appear correlated around metal-rich hosts. The relation between the two types of planets remains unclear for stars with metal-poor hosts due to the limited sample size and the much lower occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, but a correlation between the two cannot be ruled out.},

  abstract = {Seven rocky planets orbit the nearby dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, providing a unique opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar System1. Thanks to the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are now detectable2,3. Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1\,b showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO2 in its atmosphere4. Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of TRAPPIST-1\,c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15\,{\textmu}m. We measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of fp/f⁎\,=\,421\,{\textpm}\,94 parts per million (ppm), which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380\,{\textpm}\,31\,K. This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on the planet. The data rule out cloud-free O2/CO2 mixtures with surface pressures ranging from 10\,bar (with 10\,ppm CO2) to 0.1\,bar (pure CO2). A Venus-analogue atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6{$\sigma$} confidence. Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1\,c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less than \$\$\{9.5\}\_\{-2.3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+7.5\}\$\$Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for the potentially habitable planets in the system.},

  abstract = {Lava worlds belong to a class of short orbital period planets reaching dayside temperatures high enough to melt their silicate crust. Theory predicts that the resulting lava oceans outgas their volatile components, attaining equilibrium with the overlying vapour. This creates a tenuous, silicate-rich atmosphere that may be confined to the permanent dayside of the planet. The launch of JWST will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage to characterise these worlds. In this paper, we assess the observability of characterisable spectral features by self-consistently modelling silicate atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having sufficient substellar temperatures ({$>$} 1500 K). To achieve this we use outgassed equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer methods to compute temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical compositions and emission spectra. We explore varying melt compositions, free of highly-volatile elements, accounting for possible atmospheric evolution. Our models include a large number of neutral and ionic species, as well as all up-to-date opacities. The results indicate that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are the best, unique identifiers of silicate atmospheres, detectable using MIRI instrument of JWST. Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong constraints on atmospheric thermal structure and possibly the composition of the melt. We also propose that certain species, e.g., TiO, may be directly tied to different classes of melts, possibly revealing surface and interior dynamics. Currently, there are nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation of silicate atmospheres using JWST, with two of these already accepted for the initial General Observers program.},

  abstract = {This study considers the characteristics of planetary systems with giant planets based on a population-level analysis of the California Legacy Survey planet catalog. We identified three characteristics common to hot Jupiters. First, while not all hot Jupiters have a detected outer giant planet companion (\$M {\textbackslash}sin i\$ = 0.3--30 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{Jup\}\}\$), such companions are ubiquitous when survey completeness corrections are applied for orbital periods out to 40,000 days. Giant harboring systems without a hot Jupiter also host at least one outer giant planet companion per system. Second, the mass distributions of hot Jupiters and other giant planets are indistinguishable. However, within a planetary system that includes a hot Jupiter, the outer giant planet companions are at least \$3{\textbackslash}times\$ more massive than the inner hot Jupiters. Third, the eccentricity distribution of the outer companions in hot Jupiter systems (with an average model eccentricity of \${\textbackslash}langle e{\textbackslash}rangle=0.34{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$) is different from the corresponding outer planets in planetary systems without hot Jupiters (\${\textbackslash}langle e{\textbackslash}rangle=0.19{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$). We conclude that the existence of two gas giants, where the outermost planet has an eccentricity \${\textbackslash}ge0.2\$ and is \$3{\textbackslash}times\$ more massive, are key factors in the production of a hot Jupiter. Our simple model based on these factors predicts that \${\textbackslash}sim\$10{\textbackslash}\% of warm and cold Jupiter systems will by chance meet these assembly criteria, which is consistent with our measurement of \$16{\textbackslash}pm6{\textbackslash}\%\$ relative occurrence of hot Jupiter systems to all giant-harboring systems. We find that these three features favor coplanar high-eccentricity migration as the dominant mechanism for hot Jupiter formation.},

  abstract = {In this study, we performed a homogeneous analysis of the planets around FGK dwarf stars observed by the Kepler and K2 missions, providing spectroscopic parameters for 310 K2 targets ---including 239 Scaling K2 hosts---observed with Keck/HIRES. For orbital periods less than 40 days, we found that the distribution of planets as a function of orbital period, stellar effective temperature, and metallicity was consistent between K2 and Kepler, reflecting consistent planet formation efficiency across numerous {$\sim$}1 kpc sight-lines in the local Milky Way. Additionally, we detected a 3{\texttimes} excess of sub-Saturns relative to warm Jupiters beyond 10 days, suggesting a closer association between sub-Saturn and sub-Neptune formation than between sub-Saturn and Jovian formation. Performing a joint analysis of Kepler and K2 demographics, we observed diminishing super-Earth, sub-Neptune, and sub-Saturn populations at higher stellar effective temperatures, implying an inverse relationship between formation and disk mass. In contrast, no apparent host-star spectral-type dependence was identified for our population of Jupiters, which indicates gas-giant formation saturates within the FGK mass regimes. We present support for stellar metallicity trends reported by previous Kepler analyses. Using Gaia DR3 proper motion and radial velocity measurements, we discovered a galactic location trend; stars that make large vertical excursions from the plane of the Milky Way host fewer super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While oscillation amplitude is associated with metallicity, metallicity alone cannot explain the observed trend, demonstrating that galactic influences are imprinted on the planet population. Overall, our results provide new insights into the distribution of planets around FGK dwarf stars and the factors that influence their formation and evolution.},
