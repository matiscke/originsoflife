\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\todo[inline]{Introduce OOL, the importance of planetary contexts}

\section{Origins of Life Scenarios and their predictions}
\todo[inline]{Present widely discussed OOL scenarios and their predictions on exoplanet observables; derive testable hypotheses.}
\label{sec:ool_scenarios}
In this section, we present some of the most prominent origins of life scenarios and their observational predictions.
We focus on the necessary environmental conditions for the processes and reactions inherent to each scenario, and aim to identify distinct observables that are accessible via present and near-future remote sensing techniques.

\subsection{Hydrothermal vents}
e.g., Russell+2010
...
The hydrothermal vents scenario requires a direct contact of an ocean and the planetary mantle/crust.
This requirement is not met on an ocean world with large amounts of water, where the water pressure on the ocean floor is high enough to form high-pressure ices (Noack+2016).
\todo[inline]{see discussion in Kite \& Ford 2018 Sect. 6.4}

\textbf{Prediction:} Planets with high-pressure ices do not show biosignatures.


\subsection{Subaerial ponds}
...
By its nature, the subaerial ponds scenario relies on rock surfaces exposed to the planetary atmosphere.
Water worlds that have their entire planetary surface covered with water contradict this requirement and do not allow for the wet-dry cycling inherent to this origin of life scenario.
The competition of tectonic stress with gravitational crustal spreading (Melosh 2011) sets the maximum possible height of mountains, which in the solar system does not exceed $\sim \SI{20}{\kilo\meter}$.
Such mountains will be permanently under water on water worlds.
Another impediment to wet-dry cycles is tidal locking of the planet as it stalls stellar tide-induced water movement and diurnal irradiation variability.

\textbf{Prediction:} Biosignatures occur outside the tidal locking zone and at bulk densities consistent with exposed rock..

\subsection{Cyanosulfidic scenario}
...
A strong requirement for the cyanosulfidic scenario is a sufficient Ultraviolet (UV) flux incident on the planet.
On planets that have never received significant UV fluxes, the relevant photochemistry is limited.

\textbf{Prediction:} Past UV flux and the occurrence of biosignatures are correlated.


\subsection{Other Processes related to the Origins of Life}
\subsubsection{Planetary redox state and evolution}
The synthesis of prebiotic compounds requires moderately to highly reduced chemical environments (Kitadai \& Maruyama 2018, Benner+2020, Sasselov+2020, Lichtenberg \& Clement 2022).
...
Surficial origins of life chemistries are dependent on the redox state of a planet being $\sim$neutral (not too reduced or oxidized) to allow the presence of precursor molecules like HCN. The planetary redox state leaves an imprint on its atmospheric composition and thus planet size (very reduced atmospheres are large) and spectral signatures. Connected to the cyanosulfidic scenario, the pond scenario, and the impact trigger.

\subsubsection{Impact trigger}
Iron-rich impactors have been suggested to intermittently provide the reduced environments favored by prebiotic chemistry (e.g., Sekine+2003, Hashimoto+2007, Kuwahara \& Sugita 2015, Genda+2017, Wogan+2023).
...
Prebiotic synthesis triggered through reduced impactors that stochastically create transiently reducing or neutral atmospheres requires a certain composition of the impactors, the planet to not be in a magma ocean state (???) (Lichtenberg \& Clement 2022), and, related to this requirement, occurrence of impact events during early planetary evolution.
Suggested observables are stochastic increases in brightness temperature, transient increases of planet size, and change of planet composition (decreasing with decreasing impact rate, i.e., stellar age).

\section{Exoplanet survey simulations}
\todo[inline]{Focus on molecular Oxygen as a biomarker(?)}
A commonly discussed biomarker is molecular Oxygen (O$_2$), which on Earth emerged as a byproduct of photosynthesis during the Proterozoic era.
While not the only atmospheric species discussed as a signature for planetary life CITE, we focused on O$_2$ as a representative biomarker for our spectroscopic survey simulations.
