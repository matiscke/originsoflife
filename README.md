# _Bioverse_: Potentially Observable Exoplanet Biosignature Patterns Under the UV Threshold Hypothesis for the Origin of Life

A [Bioverse](https://github.com/danielapai/bioverse) project to explore how hypotheses on the Origins of Life can be tested with future exoplanet surveys.

## Scope
This repository contains the code necessary to create the results and figures in Schlecker et al. (2025). In this study, we explore how exoplanet surveys can test origins-of-life hypotheses by linking biosignature distributions to proposed abiogenesis scenarios. Focusing on the cyanosulfidic origins model, we investigate whether a minimum near-ultraviolet (NUV) flux is required for life to emerge. 

Using Bayesian modeling and the [Bioverse](https://github.com/danielapai/bioverse) survey simulator, we assess the probability of detecting strong evidence for or against this “UV Threshold Hypothesis” in future biosignature surveys. We find that sample sizes of at least ~50 planets are needed for meaningful constraints, with the power of such tests depending on abiogenesis rates and host star properties. Surveys targeting diverse stellar environments, particularly M dwarfs, improve diagnostic potential, with ~100 planets yielding a high likelihood of conclusive results if moderate NUV fluxes are required. However, if life requires very high NUV levels, both habitability and testability decrease sharply. 

Our results highlight the broader importance of survey simulations for designing exoplanet missions (e.g., HWO, LIFE, ELTs, Nautilus) and refining theoretical models of abiogenesis.
